/* Upstart state machine.
 *
 * Generate with:
 *   dot -Tpng -ostates.png states.dot
 *
 * Diamonds represent natural rest states in which we need to take an action
 * to change the goal.
 *
 * Ovals represent ordinary states which clear themselves when the process
 * being run, or the event that was emitted, finishes.
 *
 * Rectangles represent additional actions that are taken, they are not
 * states, instead you should follow through them to the next real state.
 *
 * Green arrows are followed while the goal is START.
 * Red arrows are followed while the goal is STOP.
 *
 * Note that from the running state, there are two read arrows leaving it;
 * these are chosen based on whether there is a process for the job or not.
