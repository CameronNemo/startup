2007-02-25  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Shift the signal value into the
	higher byte to make it easier to detect, and not stamp over exit
	statuses between 128 and 255.
	(job_emit_event): Detect the signal stored in the new way.
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_normal): Store signal in the higher bytes.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_copy, test_change_state) 
	(test_child_reaper): Update test cases.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_normal): Update test.

	* TODO: Update.

	* init/event.h (PWRSTATUS_EVENT): Add new power-status-changed event.
	* init/main.c (pwd_handler): Handle the SIGPWR signal by generating
	the new event, leave it up to a job to parse the file and do
	whatever it likes.

	* TODO: Update.

2007-02-13  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_reader, test_handle_using)
	(test_handle); Usual fix for gcc optimiser thinking that fixed
	for loops might not be.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_run_process, test_kill_process):
	Likewise.
	* init/tests/test_notify.c (test_subscription_find): I still don't
	know what a type-punned pointer is, nor why dereferencing such a
	thing would break strict-aliasing rules.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): More type-punning.
	* util/tests/test_jobs.c (test_start_action): More for-loop action.
	* util/tests/test_events.c (test_emit_action): And again.

2007-02-11  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/job.c (job_change_goal): We need to be able to stop a running
	job without a process, because that's what a job-as-state is!  The
	check was added because job_child_reaper calls job_change_goal and
	then job_change_state immediately after, we should fix that instead.
	(job_child_reaper): If we call job_change_goal while in the running
	state, it will call job_change_state for us; so check for that first
	and don't change the state!
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_goal): Update the test to ensure
	that we can stop a job with no running process.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_normalexit): normalexit is inconsistent,
	change to "normal exit"
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_normalexit): Update.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_start, cfg_stanza_stop) 
	(cfg_stanza_pre_start, cfg_stanza_post_start) 
	(cfg_stanza_pre_stop, cfg_stanza_post_stop, cfg_stanza_respawn):
	We're not going to allow stanza keywords to be quoted, since this
	gives us an easy way to allow users to make something explicitly
	not a keyword.

2007-02-10  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	for a token when parsing "exec".  Correct line number we expect
	to see the duplicated value on.  Correct expected error for missing
	argument from "Unexpected token" to "Expected token".

	* TOOD: Minor notify bug

	* TODO: Big update.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Make sure that we can
	reap post-start and pre-stop processes, and have only the aux_pid
	changed.  Also make sure that if the running process dies while
	in these states, with or without an aux process, that we don't
	transition badly.

	* init/job.c (job_find_by_pid): Check aux_pid as well.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_find_by_pid): Make sure we can find it.

	post-start or pre-stop processes.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Add tests for running
	the new post-start and pre-stop scripts; which get their process ids
	stored in aux_pid instead of pid.
	(test_new): Make sure the aux_pid member is initialised properly.
	(test_copy): Make sure the aux_pid member is not copied.

	* TODO: Update.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Add a check for the
	daemon stanza holding the job in spawned; we snuck this in a while
	back and never tested it (there's no support to get it out of
	spawned yet).

	* init/job.h (Job): Add new post_start and pre_stop scripts.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Initialise new scripts to NULL.
	(job_copy): Copy the information from the new scripts over as well.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check they're initialised.
	(test_copy): Check that the information is copied properly.
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_post_start, cfg_stanza_pre_stop): Add
	new script stanza functions for the additional two scripts that
	we want.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_post_start)

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_exec, cfg_stanza_script): Rewrite to
	allocate a JobProcess and parse the command or script into it.
	(cfg_read_job): Fix the long broken assumption that pid_file and
	pid_binary are required for respawn, when they're actually required
	for daemon.
	(cfg_stanza_start, cfg_stanza_stop): Remove script second-level.
	(cfg_stanza_respawn): Parse into the job's process.
	(cfg_stanza_pre_start, cfg_stanza_post_stop): New stanzas for the
	processes alone.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Update a few test
	cases to match reality.
	(test_stanza_start, test_stanza_stop): Remove script-related checks.

2007-02-09  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_kill_process): Poll the event queue
	after each test to get rid of the allocated events and make valgrind
	happy.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_job_start, test_job_stop)
	(test_event_emit): Poll the event queue after each test to get rid
	of the allocated events, as they make valgrind complain.
	(test_event_emit): Free args and env when done.

	* init/job.h (JobName): Drop obsolete structure
	(JobProcess): Add a new structure to represent a single process
	within the job, instead of using two variables to pick either the
	script or command.
	(Job): Change command and script to a single JobProcess called process;
	change start_script and stop_script to a JobProcess called pre_start
	and post_stop respectively.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Initialise new members to NULL.
	(job_copy): Copy the process structures across, including contents.

	JobProcess to specify the command.

	* init/main.c (main): Run job_free_deleted each time through the
	main loop.

	* init/job.c (job_change_goal): Minor tweak to the logic; we may
	have just made the job an instance, that should still let us stop
	the one underneath.

	* TODO: Update.

	* util/jobs.c (do_job): Always expect a list of replies.

	* init/control.c (control_job_status, control_job_stop)
	(control_job_query): Reply with information about all instances of
	the job.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_job_status, test_job_stop)
	(test_job_query): Make sure we get the list end even for a single job;
	and make sure we get details of all instances attached to the job.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_goal): Check that starting
	an instance job actually starts a new instance of it.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_limit): Support the word "unlimited" in
	limit arguments for both the soft and hard values.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_limit): Make sure that we

	the state as it is.
	* init/job.h: Add prototype.

	* init/job.c (job_find_by_name): If we get a job that's an instance,
	return what it's an instance of.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_find_by_name): Restore accidentally
	deleted test function; test that we get the real job, not an instance.

	* init/job.c (job_new): instance_of is initialised to NULL.
	* init/job.h: Add a new instance_of pointer, pointing to the parent
	that we're an instance of.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check that.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Make sure instance_of
	pointers are updated.

	* init/job.c (jobs): Store jobs in a hash table.
	(job_new): Add to hash table, not to a list.
	(job_handle_event, job_handle_event_finished, job_detect_stalled) 
	(job_free_deleted): Iterate across the hash table, rather than list.
	(job_find_by_name): Use nih_hash_lookup, we keep this function because
	we'll add "is instance or not" smarts soon!
	(job_find_by_pid): Iterate across the entire hash table.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_find_by_name): Drop test since this
	function is now gone.
	(test_free_deleted): Can't assume things are in a line now.
	* init/control.c (control_job_list): Iterate the hash table.

	* init/event.c: Don't hide the events list anymore
	* init/event.h: Publish it and the init function.
	* init/job.c: Don't hide the jobs list anymore.

	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Ship the states diagram.
	(states.png): Include rules to build the png, we'll put it in bzr
	anyway, but this is useful.

	the job as deleted, and if it's dormant, invoke a state change.

	* upstart/enum.h: Add a new JOB_DELETED state.
	* upstart/enum.c (job_state_name, job_state_from_name): Add the new
	state to the string functions.
	* upstart/tests/test_enum.c (test_state_name) 
	(test_state_from_name): Check the enum works.
	* init/job.c (job_change_goal): New decision; we can start a waiting
	job if it's marked delete (it might be a new instance) -- we'll use
	the new deleted state to decide that we shouldn't.
	(job_change_state): Once we reach waiting, if the job is to be deleted,
	move to the next state.
	(job_next_state): The next state for a waiting job if the goal is stop
	is deleted.  We should never call job_next_state () for a deleted job.
	(job_free_deleted): Very simple function, just detects
	deleted jobs and frees them.
	* init/job.h: Add prototype for new function.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_goal): Update test to use new
	deleted state; and don't even change the goal.

	job gets resurrected.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_visitor): Correct number of arguments and call

	* init/job.c (job_handle_event_finished): Function to unblock all
	jobs blocked on a given event emission.
	(job_new, job_emit_event): Rename blocker to blocked; it's useful for
	testing for truth.
	* init/job.h: Add prototype, rename member.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_handle_event_finished): Test it.
	(test_new, test_change_state): Update name here too.
	* init/event.c (event_finished): Call job_handle_event_finished
	function to unblock jobs.
	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_poll): Make sure the job gets
	unblocked; a few other tests have to change since running event_poll
	always unblocks the job if nothing listens to it.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Set failed back to FALSE if
	we're respawning, since we don't want to be failing.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): cause will be NULL.
	also free and poll events when done.
	(test_handle_event): pid can never be -1

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Process will always
	be zero on return from reaper.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Killed doesn't go past
	stopping; it goes to waiting, which will clear the cause.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Fill in values before
	we test against them.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_kill_process): Fix violated assertion

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): This should be failed
	because nothing cleared it.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Fix a couple of array
	index problems.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Why set that which
	does not change?

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Add newline to test.

	* init/job.c (job_emit_event): Add the job name as an argument;
	oops.

	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_job_stop): Need to kill the process
	ourselves, as we're blocked on an event.
	(test_job_query): Fix wrong value in test.

	name to match the test.

	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Must only not enter some states

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_handle_event): Clean up tests.
	(test_detect_stalled): Clean up.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Update the reaping of the child
	processes; there's a much larger state range for the main process
	now, so that needs to be taken into account.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): New test cases.

	* init/job.c (job_next_state): Encapsulate the slightly odd three
	exit states of running in this function, otherwise we'll end up
	special-casing it in places I'd rather not think about.
	(job_change_goal): Only change the state of a running job if it
	has a process.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_next_state): Add a test case for the
	dead running job
	(test_change_goal): Add test case for the dead running job

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Add test cases for
	the forgotten stopping to killed transition.

	* init/job.c (job_kill_process, job_kill_timer): Just check the pid
	and state, and no longer any need to notify jobs since we're just
	called from one state amongst many.
	(job_change_state): Skip over the killed state if there's no process.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_kill_process): Update test cases.

	* init/job.c (job_run_process): Simplify a little bit, no need to
	do the state assertions here, just make sure there's no already
	a process running.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_run_command, test_run_script): Run
	tests in the spawned state, since that's where we run the primary
	command or script.  Drop check for process state since that's no
	longer set.

	* init/job.c (job_change_state, job_next_state): Ok, here's the big
	one ... rewrite this to use the new state transitions.  This has
	suddenly got a lot simpler and easier to read, this was definitely a
	good idea.
	(job_emit_event): Function to make emission of events easier.
	(job_failed_event): replaces this one which wasn't so easy.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): I can't say how much I
	wasn't looking forwards to rewriting these test cases; anyway, it's
	done now and I hope they're all right;
	(test_next_state): Make sure the state transitions are correct too.

	* init/job.h: Rename is_instance to delete and spawns_instance to
	just instance.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Update.

	* init/job.h: Add blocker event member.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Initialise it to NULL.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check it.

	* init/job.c (job_change_goal): Have a stab at this function with the
	new state machine; it gets somewhat simpler (until we introduce the
	second scripts), now we just induce things by a state change.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_goal): Made easier (for now)
	because we don't need to deal with processes and can just wait to
	be blocked on an event.

	* init/job.h (Job): Drop the process_state member.

	* util/jobs.c (handle_job_status): Drop the process_state and

	* util/events.c (handle_event_job_status): Simplify in the same way

	Update handling of the messages to reduce the arguments.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_new, my_handler) 
	(test_handle): Update the tests for the new job status message.

	* upstart/enum.h (JobState): Change the job states to the new set
	of states that we've planned.

	contained in the single JobState field.
	* upstart/enum.c (job_state_name, job_state_from_name): Update
	strings to match the new state names.

	define states others can use.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Convert the test to
	a "must work".
	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Remove restriction that we must
	have either a script or a command; having neither should just wedge
	the job at the running rest state.  Note that there's no way to get
	it out yet, because we don't force that particular state change.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Make sure that works.

	* init/job.c (job_change_cause): Put the knowledge about how to
	change the cause into a separate function, since it's slightly
	tricky.

	init/tests/test_notify.c: Likewise.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Don't change the goal event; the
	state changes will handle this.
	(job_change_goal): Only dereference/reference the goal event if we're
	actually changing it.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state, test_child_reaper):
	Update tests to not assume that the goal event gets changed.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Correct some problems with job and

	stop; since we likely caused it.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): More test cases.

	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_shutdown): Don't detect the idle
	event (and thus the second event)

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_service): Parser for service stanza.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_service): Test the service
	stanza.
	(test_stanza_respawn): Check that respawn implies service.
	* TODO: Update.

	* init/job.h (Job): Add a new service member.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Service starts off as false.
	(job_change_state): Check service instead of respawn.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Check with service
	instead of respawn, since that's what we really mean.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_read_job): Copy a whole bunch more state
	into the newly parsed job.
	* init/job.c (job_run_process): Only output the first error.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Make sure important
	things are copied.
	* TODO: Update.

	* init/main.c: Restore a much simplified version of the term
	handler that doesn't try and copy across any state.

	* init/event.c, init/job.c, init/main.c, init/tests/test_event.c,
	init/tests/test_job.c: Completely drop the serialisation code, it's
	getting out of date and in the way.

	* init/event.h: Remove compatibility macros.
	(EventEmission): Drop the callback function; it was too error prone
	to try and do it this way, and we only ever wanted to release a job
	anyway as control requests are better handled through the notify
	interface.
	(EventEmissionCb): Drop unused typedef.
	* init/event.c (event_emit): Drop callback argument.
	(event_finished): Don't call the callback
	* init/tests/test_event.c: Update to avoid callbacks.

	(notify_unsubscribe): New subscription and unsubscription functions

	subscription to individual jobs or events.
	* init/tests/test_notify.c (test_subscribe_job) 
	(test_subscribe_event, test_unsubscribe): Test the new subscription
	functions, replacing the old
	(test_subscribe): tests.

	via the goal event are notified too.
	* init/event.c (event_pending): Pass the emission directly.
	(event_finished): Notify subscribers that the event has finished.
	* init/control.c (control_error_handler): Call notify_unsubscribe
	(control_watch_jobs, control_unwatch_jobs, control_watch_events) 
	(control_unwatch_events): Update to the new subscription API.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_error_handler): Use new API
	(test_watch_jobs, test_unwatch_jobs, test_watch_events)
	(test_unwatch_events): Also update these to the new API; use a

	* init/tests/test_process.c: Don't use printf, use TEST_FUNCTION

2007-02-07  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* upstart/message.h: Allocate new grouped event messages.
	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_new, upstart_message_handle):
	Add support for the new grouped event messages.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_new, test_handle) 
	(my_handler): Make sure the new messages are passed correctly.

	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Clear the goal event whenever we
	reach the final rest state of a job (waiting for all jobs, running
	for services).
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Check that the goal
	event goes away at the right times.
	* TODO: Update.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Make sure that the
	event is marked failed properly

	* init/job.c (job_start_event, job_stop_event): There's no reason
	for these to exist as seperate functions anymore, especially since
	we want to eventually have some kind of match table.
	(job_handle_event): Perform the iterations and match calls here
	instead, since we just call job_change_goal now.
	* init/job.h: Remove prototypes.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_start_event, test_stop_event): Fold into
	(test_handle_event): which now handles all the cases.

	* init/job.c (job_detect_idle): Call event_emit
	* init/main.c (main, cad_handler, kbd_handler): Call event_emit
	instead of event_queue.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state, test_child_reaper) 
	(test_detect_idle, test_change_state): Update to use newer event API.
	* TODO: Update.

	* init/job.c (job_start, job_stop): Drop these functions; call
	job_change_goal instead (which is now public).
	(job_change_state, job_child_reaper): Call job_change_goal instead.
	* init/job.h: Update.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_start, test_stop): Merge into new
	(test_change_goal): function.
	* init/main.c (main): Call job_change_goal instead of job_start.
	* init/control.c (control_job_start, control_job_stop): Call
	job_change_goal instead.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new, test_change_state) 
	(test_run_script, test_start, test_stop, test_start_event): 

	* init/job.h (Job): goal_event is now an EventEmission, and is
	a direct pointer to the one in the events queue, rather than a copy.
	* init/process.c (process_setup_environment): Reference the event
	name and environment through the goal event, not directly.
	* init/job.c (job_run_script): Reference the event name and
	environment through the goal event, not directly.
	(job_change_state, job_child_reaper): Replace direct setting of the
	job goal with a call to job_stop; the process state is always
	PROCESS_NONE in all three cases, so this is completely safe.
	(_job_start, _job_stop): Merge these two functions together into
	(job_change_goal): which behaves a lot more like job_change_state,
	except that it doesn't loop.  This handles the changing of the
	emission.
	(job_start, job_start_event, job_stop, job_stop_event): Simplify
	these functions, now they just call job_change_goal passing in
	the emission pointer (or NULL).

	init/tests/test_job.c, init/tests/test_event.c: Remove state
	serialisation code for the time being; maintaining it is getting
	increasingly harder, and it introduces some major bugs.  It will
	get rewritten shortly.

	* init/event.c (event_pending): Pass the emission directly to
	job_handle_event now.
	* init/job.c (job_handle_event, job_start_event, job_stop_event):
	Deal with event emissions rather than just plain events, the change
	so far doesn't do anything else other than take the structure change.
	* init/job.h: Change prototypes.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_start_event, test_stop_event)
	(test_handle_event): Update tests to use emissions.

	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_read_state, test_write_state): Check
	the passing of the progress information.
	* init/event.c (event_read_state, event_write_state): Add progress
	field to the serialisation (oops).

	* init/event.h: Add missing attribute for event_read_state.
	* init/cfgfile.h: Add missing attributes.
	* init/main.c (read_state): Don't discard return value.

	Event really being an EventEmission.
	* init/event.c (event_emit): Make the next emission id a static global
	(event_read_state, event_write_state): Serialise event emission
	structures, not plain events; also send over the last id we used so
	it appears seamless.  This doesn't yet handle the callback/data bit
	of the serialisation, which turns out to be a little tricky ... oops
	* init/event.h: Update.
	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_read_state, test_write_state): Check
	that serialisation is done with EventEmissions instead, and all the
	fields are passed (except callback and data which are ... tricky).

	* init/main.c (main): Call event_poll instead of event_queue_run.

	* init/event.c (event_poll): Add the new function that replaces
	event_queue_run(); handles the new-style event emission structures
	in the list and only returns when there are no non-handling events.
	(event_pending, event_finished): Handling of particular event states
	during poll; split out for readability.
	(event_queue, event_queue_run): Drop these obsolete functions.
	(event_read_state): Force type from event_queue.
	* init/event.h: Add event_poll prototype; remove prototypes of old
	functions, replacing with #defines for now so things still compile.
	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_queue): Drop tests.
	(test_read_state, test_write_state): Force type from event_queue
	Change type we check size of.
	(test_poll): Pretty thoroughly test the new poll function.
	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Force type from event_queue
	* init/control.c (control_event_queue): Force type from event queue

	(event_emit_find_by_id): Simplify now it just checks one list

	queue to pick up.

	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_emit): Make sure that the emission
	id is unique each time.

	returns an EventEmission structure with the details filled in as
	given.
	* init/event.h: Add prototype.

	* init/event.c (event_init): Rename the single events queue to
	pending and add a new handling list.

	structure that wraps an event, for use in the queue.

	sorry about that.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Rewrite this to make the logic a
	little easier to follow, and support signals in normalexit.  This
	also now applies to deciding whether the job failed, if it did, we
	store that information in the job so the stop and stopped events
	can get it.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_child_reaper): Add new test cases for
	the setting of the failed flags.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_normalexit): Allow signal names in the
	arguments, which are added to the normalexit array or'd with 0x80
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_normalexit): Check that we
	can now parse signal names correctly.

	* init/job.c (job_failed_event): Change add to addp to fix leak.

	* init/job.c (job_failed_event): Function to turn an event into one
	that includes all the necessary arguments and environment.

	(test_stanza_stop): Make sure arguments are parsed into the event.

	* init/event.c (event_new): Use nih_str_array_new.
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_env): Rewrite to use nih_str_array.

	* init/job.c (job_run_script): Check the error returned from
	nih_io_reopen; don't just loop.  We only ever expect ENOMEM (the
	other error, EBADF, is impossible).

	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Reset the goal_event to NULL when
	we catch a run-away job (as it's not stopping for the same event
	it started with).
	(job_child_reaper): Reset the goal_event to NULL after setting the
	goal to STOP.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state, test_child_reaper):
	Check that the goal event gets reset whenever the goal gets changed.

	* init/tests/test_event.c: Use TEST_ALLOC_FAIL

	* init/event.c (event_match): Match arguments using fnmatch() and
	allow more arguments in event1 than event2 (but not the other way
	around).
	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_match): Check the new permitted
	combinations.

	* init/event.h (Event): Add args and env members to Event.
	* init/event.c (event_new): Initialise args and env members to
	zero-length arrays.
	* init/tests/test_event.c (test_new): Use TEST_ALLOC_FAIL and
	make sure args and env are both initialised to a list containing
	just NULL.

	* util/jobs.c (start_action): Get the UPSTART_JOB environment variable
	and use that if we don't have any arguments passed to us.
	(do_job): Code split from the above function that handles a named job
	* util/tests/test_jobs.c (test_start_action): Make sure UPSTART_JOB
	is picked up.

	environment in the job.

	* init/job.h: Add attributes to job_new and job_read_state.

	the event name or nothing for NULL.
	(job_read_state): Parse the goal_event field
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_write_state): Make sure the state is
	written out properly.
	(test_read_state): Make sure that the state is parsed correctly too.

	* init/job.c (job_start, job_stop): Split all of the code except
	the goal_event setting into two new static functions that this calls
	(_job_start, _job_stop): New static functions
	(job_start_event, job_stop_event): Call _job_start and _job_stop
	instead of job_start and job_stop

	* init/job.c (job_catch_runaway): Move this function up a bit.

	* init/job.c (job_start, job_stop): Clear the goal_event member,
	these functions are called for a manual start.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_start, test_stop): Make sure the
	goal_event member is freed and set to NULL.

	* init/job.h (Job): Add a new goal_event member
	* init/job.c (job_new): Initialise the goal_event member to NULL.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check with TEST_ALLOC_FAIL;
	also make sure goal_event is initialised to NULL.

2007-02-05  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.3.3

	* NEWS: Update.

	* init/process.c (process_spawn): Exit with 255 so we don't clash
	with anything that uses 1 as a normal exit code.  Note why we only
	close 0..2 (everything else is FD_CLOEXEC).
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_watch_dir): Mark the inotify watch descriptor
	as FD_CLOEXEC.
	* init/control.c (control_open): nih_io_set_cloexec can only ever
	return EINVAL, so no point checking it.

2007-02-04  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/tests/test_control.c: Remove strange old code.

2007-02-03  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/control.c (control_open_sock, control_reopen)
	(control_close_handler): Drop these functions; unconnected datagram
	sockets don't close -- so why try dealing with it?
	(control_error_handler): Don't reopen the socket on error, just log
	it -- the socket should be fine, there's no remote end to be lost,
	after all.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_close_handler): Drop.
	(test_error_handler): Drop the reopen tests.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_run_script): Control socket doesn't
	get unexpectedly opened anymore; so no need to close it.

	* init/control.c (control_open): Remove the strange behaviour that
	this can be called to get the socket.  Instead make control_io
	global; we're all adults after all.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_open): Remove the test for the
	silly behaviour.
	* init/notify.c (notify_job, notify_event): Use the control_io
	pointer directly, and just do nothing if we lost it somehow.

	* init/main.c (main): Being unable tp open the control socket, or
	parse the configuration, should be a fatal error; stop being so
	damned liberal! <g>   Don't reset the signal state if we're
	being restarted, as this loses any pending signals -- be happy
	that our parent left them in a good state.  Set SIGCHLD to the
	standard handler, otherwise we might lose this before we start
	the main loop (which does the same anyway).
	(term_handler): Rework so we don't need to close and open the
	control socket; instead we just close it in the child that's
	going to send the state, and notify the parent that it's safe to
	exec (which will cause it to be closed so the new init can open it).

	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_open): Fix valgrind error
	* init/tests/test_notify.c (test_subscribe): Fix valgrind error

	* init/notify.c (notify_subscribe): Make safe against ENOMEM.
	* init/tests/test_notify.c (test_subscribe): Use TEST_ALLOC_FAIL

	* init/control.c: Add needed attributes; tidy up formatting.
	(control_open): Don't let ENOMEM fail opening the control socket.
	* init/control.h: Add needed attributes.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_open): Test for failed allocation.
	* init/main.c (term_handler): Make sure we catch failure to open
	the control socket again.

	* TODO: Update

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_watch_dir): Clean this up a bit; now we only
	output a warning if inotify failed for any reason other than not
	being supported AND walking worked.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_watch_dir): Update to even newer watch API;
	our create_handler is now always called if inotify is successful,
	so we just need to fall back to walking the directory when it
	isn't -- if inotify isn't supported, don't even bother complaining.
	(cfg_create_modify_handler): Check the stat of the file visited to
	make sure it's a regular file.
	(cfg_visitor): Check the stat of the file visited to make sure it's
	a regular file.

	* init/cfgfile.c: Update include to upstart/enum.h
	* init/job.c: Update include to upstart/enum.h
	* init/job.h: Update include to upstart/enum.h

	* logd/main.c: Add attribute to open_logging

	* util/initctl.c: Split out the command functions into new files;
	* util/jobs.c: This gets the job-related commands
	* util/events.h: This gets the event-related commands
	* util/initctl.h, util/jobs.h, util/events.h: Headers
	* util/tests/test_jobs.c: Test suite for job-related commands.
	* util/tests/test_events.c: Test suite for event-related commands.
	* util/Makefile.am (initctl_SOURCES): Add new files.
	(TESTS): Build new test suites.
	(test_jobs_SOURCES, test_jobs_LDFLAGS, test_jobs_LDADD):
	Details for job-related commands test suite binary.
	(test_events_SOURCES, test_events_LDFLAGS, test_events_LDADD):
	Details for event-related commands test suite binary.
	* TODO: Remove item about splitting initctl now we've done it.

	* TODO: Big update; strip anything we have a spec for.

	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_handle): Make sure that if we
	fail to parse a message, we don't leave strings around in memory.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_open): Check that we get a
	raised EADDRINUSE if we try an open a socket twice.
	(test_handle): Add lots of checks for things like NULL names and
	incomplete messages; as well as the obvious unknown message.
	(test_reader): Make sure that errors while handling messages are
	dealt with by logging it.

	* upstart/job.c, upstart/job.h, upstart/tests/test_job.c: Rename to
	enum.c, enum.h and tests/test_enum.c; since this just includes enums
	and convert functions really.
	* upstart/Makefile.am: Update.
	* upstart/libupstart.h: Update include.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c: Update include.

2007-02-01  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* upstart/tests/test_wire.c: Change from assert to assert0
	* init/tests/test_notify.c: Change from assert to assert0
	* init/tests/test_control.c: nih_io_message_send should always return
	a value greater than zero.

	* upstart/tests/test_wire.c: Change to use assert instead of NIH_ZERO;
	the rationale here is that in test cases we just want to fail, not
	try again repeatedly.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c: Likewise.

	* init/tests/test_control.c: Use assert to ensure we get the expected
	return values of functions that raise errors.
	* init/tests/test_notify.c: Use assert to ensure we get the expected
	return values of functions that raise errors.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_watch_dir): Port to the new NihWatch API and
	use nih_dir_walk().  This also fixes the long-standing bug where we
	wouldn't watch the configuration directory if inotify was disabled.
	Drop both the parent and prefix members for now, until we clean this
	up later.
	(cfg_create_modify_handler): Wrap cfg_read_job after figuring out
	the job name.
	(cfg_job_name): Function to figure out the job name from a path.
	(cfg_visitor): Visitor function to handle initial parsing, figuring
	out the job name; otherwise identical to the standard handler.
	* init/cfgfile.h: Update prototype for cfg_watch_dir.
	* init/main.c (main): Update call to cfg_watch_dir.

2007-01-31  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* upstart/tests/test_message.c: Use TEST_ALLOC_FAIL to make sure
	allocations are handled properly.

2007-01-30  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* upstart/wire.c: Note that if any of the push functions fail, the
	entire buffer should be discarded.
	* upstart/tests/test_wire.c (test_push_int, test_push_unsigned) 
	(test_push_string, test_push_header, test_push_pack): Us
	TEST_ALLOC_FAIL to ensure that failing to allocate memory is caught.

	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (my_handler): Free the name and
	description after checking; they aren't otherwise.

	* upstart/wire.c (upstart_push_packv, upstart_pop_packv): Consume
	a copy of the va_list, so these can be called multiple times on the
	same list without ill effect.

	* upstart/message.h: Add warn_unused_result attributes to
	upstart_message_handle and upstart_message_handle_using as they raise
	errors.

	* upstart/wire.c: push functions return negative values to indicate
	insufficient memory.
	* upstart/wire.h: Add warn_unused_result attributes to push functions

	* upstart/tests/test_message.c: Guard calls to nih_io_buffer_push and
	nih_io_message_add_control with NIH_ZERO to ensure they succeed.
	* upstart/tests/test_wire.c: Guard calls to nih_io_buffer_push

	* HACKING: Update from libnih with new Documentation,
	Function Attributes and Test Cases sections.

2007-01-10  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/main.c (crash_handler): s/SEGV/SIGSEGV/

	* init/main.c (main): Rename variable

	* TODO: Update.

	* init/main.c (main): Change the way we clear the arguments; by
	deleting just the final NULL terminator, we fool the kernel into
	only returning one argument in cmdline.

	* init/main.c (segv_handler): Rename to crash_handler and handle
	SIGABRT as well, so we can catch assertion errors.  Of course, in
	theory, with our high test converage this should never happen in
	practice <chortle>

2007-01-09  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/main.c (main): Clear arguments so that upstart only ever
	appears as /sbin/init in ps, top, etc.

	* TODO: Update.

	* util/initctl.c: Add data pointer to functions and handle calls.

	* init/control.c: Add data pointer to all functions.
	* init/tests/test_control.c: Pass data pointer to
	upstart_message_handle_using()

	upstart_message_handle_using()

	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_handle) 
	(upstart_message_handle_using): Add a data pointer argument to these
	functions and pass it to the handler.
	(upstart_message_reader): Pass the io structure's data pointer.
	* upstart/message.h (UpstartMessageHandler): Add a data pointer to
	the message handler.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_handle, test_handle_using):
	Pass a data pointer to the function call and check it's passed
	to the handler correctly.
	(test_reader): Check that the io data pointer gets passed.

	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_console, test_stanza_env) 
	(test_stanza_umask, test_stanza_nice, test_stanza_limit): Finish off
	the newer style test cases.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_console, cfg_stanza_umask)
	(cfg_stanza_nice, cfg_stanza_limit, cfg_stanza_chroot)
	(cfg_stanza_chdir): Guard against duplicate uses of the stanzas.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_daemon) 
	(test_stanza_respawn): Check that neither daemon or respawn override
	exec if they have no arguments.
	(test_stanza_script): Add missing function
	(test_stanza_chroot, test_stanza_chdir): Add tests for these simple
	stanzas.

	* init/cfgfile.c: Change remaining uses of nih_error_raise and
	return to just nih_return_error.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_exec, cfg_stanza_daemon)
	(cfg_stanza_respawn, cfg_stanza_script): Disallow duplicates,
	both of command strings, scripts, limits and of just the flags.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_exec) 
	(test_stanza_daemon, test_stanza_respawn, test_stanza_instance):
	Check the behaviour of these stanzas.
	
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_start, cfg_stanza_stop): Disallow
	duplicate values for the script.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_start, test_stanza_stop):
	Test cases for those two functions.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_description, cfg_stanza_author) 
	(cfg_stanza_version): Don't allow stanza to be duplicated anymore.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_description) 
	(test_stanza_author, test_stanza_version): Test cases for these
	simple stanza; making sure duplication is not permitted.
	(test_stanza_on): Add a test case for this stanza too.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_kill): Guard against duplicate uses
	of the kill timeout stanza.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_kill): Test the complex
	kill stanza.
	(test_stanza_pid): Check duplicate usage results in an error.

	* init/job.h (Job): Rename pidfile to pid_file and binary to pid_binary
	* init/job.c (job_new): Update names here too.
	* init/errors.h: Add a new "duplicate value" error.
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_read_job): Change name of variables, and catch
	the duplicate value error to add the line number.
	(cfg_stanza_pid): Change variable names, and clean this function up
	a little.  Make it an error to use a stanza more than once.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_pid): Write a newer test
	case function for the pid stanza.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_normalexit): Use do/while instead of
	while, that we don't have to test has_token first as next_arg does
	that for us.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_normalexit): Change to peek at the next
	token to see whether it's missing or not, and then just fetch each
	next argument at a time.  This is more efficient than parsing them
	all in one go, and also means we can report the error in the right
	place!
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_normalexit): Since we've
	changed the function that parses the stanza, add a proper test case
	function for it, covering all the behaviours.

	* init/job.c (job_new): Initialise the emits member to an empty list.
	* init/job.h (Job): Add the emits member as a list.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check the emits list starts off
	empty.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_stanza_emits): Test the new emits
	stanza; this function will also serve as a prototype for cleaning up
	the config tests.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_emits): Add function to parse the new
	emits stanza.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_stanza_depends): Remove the depends stanza
	from the configuration file.  Dependency support has never been used,
	and is to be replaced by a more flexible event/state configuration
	and blocking on the starting/stopping events.
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c: Remove references and tests for the
	depends stanza.
	* init/job.h: Remove the depends list from the job structure.
	* init/job.c (job_new): No depends list to initialise.
	(job_change_state): No dependencies to release
	(job_start): No dependencies to iterate; this removes a particularly
	hairy and complex interaction between state changes.  Remove the
	dependency event.
	(job_release_depends): Drop this function.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_start, test_stop): Massively simplify
	these tests cases now we don't have dependencies to worry about.
	(test_release_depends): Drop tests

2007-01-08  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/cfgfile.c: Rewrite using the nih_config API, rather than one
	huge function we now just have seperate handler functions for each
	stanza.  We can also use more fine-grained parsing than slurping
	all args in and counting them.
	(cfg_read_job): Catch exceptions from the configuration parser and
	add the line number where the problem occurred to an output message.
	Parser errors are now fatal, and not ignored.
	* init/errors.h: Add a file containing errors raised within the init
	daemon codebase.
	* init/Makefile.am (init_SOURCES): Build with errors.h
	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c: Update test cases now we don't expect
	a job to be returned if there's a parser error.

	* TODO: Update

2007-01-06  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* logd/main.c (logging_reader): Fix inadvertent shadowing of the
	len parameter.

	* compat/sysv/telinit.c: Oops, nearly forgot to port this to send
	the messages in the new way.
	* compat/sysv/shutdown.c (shutdown_now): Likewise, port this too.

	* TODO: Update.

	* util/initctl.c (handle_job_status): Output the process argument,
	not the pid argument which contains the origin of the message.

	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_handle): Raise a new unknown
	message error if we don't have a handler  and a new illegal message
	error if the source is illegal.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_handle): Adjust tests to check
	for the new errors that we raise.
	* upstart/errors.h: Define strings for new errors.

	* util/initctl.c: Yet another makeover for this little program,
	port it to the new message/control framework using handler functions
	and NihIoMessage.  This starts to make each action function look
	very similar, so there's method to this madness.

2007-01-05  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* logd/main.c (main): Make sure that we add the SIGTERM handler.

	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_run_script): This test case relies
	on there only being one file descriptor watch, which won't be true
	if the control socket has been opened because there's a message to
	go out.  Make sure it's closed first.

	* init/init.supp: Update supressions file now that control_init
	has been renamed to notify_init

	* init/Makefile.am: Include notify.o from all tests.
	* init/job.c (job_change_state, job_kill_process, job_start) 
	(job_stop): Use the new notify_job function name.
	* init/event.c (event_queue_run): Use the new notify_event function
	name.

	* init/control.c (control_error_handler): Handle ECONNREFUSED now
	that the process id is available to us.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_error_handler): Make sure children
	going away is handled properly.

	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_new): Store the process id in
	the int_data message field.
	* upstart/tests/test_message.c (test_new): Check the int_data field
	is filled in.

	* init/main.c (main): Guard against various things returning an error
	that we weren't catching.

	* init/tests/test_notify.c: Whitespace fix.

	* init/control.c (control_watch_jobs, control_unwatch_jobs) 
	(control_watch_events, control_unwatch_events): Restore functionality
	to subscribe and unsubscribe from job and event notifications.	
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_watch_jobs, test_unwatch_jobs) 
	(test_watch_events, test_unwatch_events): Check that the subscription
	and unsubscription messages work.
	* init/Makefile.am (test_control_LDADD): Link to notify.o

	* init/control.c: Drop unused include of upstart/errors.h

	* init/notify.c: Move functions that handle subscription and
	notification from control.c.  Other than changing the names, we're
	keeping the API the same for now; expect it to change later when we
	add the ability to subscribe to individual jobs or events.
	(notify_init): initialise the subscriptions list; we don't have a
	separate send queue now that the control I/O is always asynchronous.
	* init/notify.h: Moved notification enum, structure and prototypes
	from control.h, changing the names so they match notify_* in the
	process.
	* init/Makefile.am (init_SOURCES): Build and link notify.c using
	notify.h
	(TESTS): Build the notify test suite binary.
	(test_notify_SOURCES, test_notify_LDFLAGS, test_notify_LDADD): Details
	for notify test suite binary.
	* init/tests/test_notify.c: Rewrite test cases in the manner of
	test_control.c so that we have one function for notify_job and
	one for notify_event, each of which contains the child process that
	receives the notification,

	* init/control.c (control_open): Allow this to be called to obtain
	the control socket, which means we can make it static.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_open): Check that it works.

	* init/control.c, init/control.h, init/tests/test_control.c: Move
	functions that handle subscription and notification to new notify.c
	(control_init): Drop completely, no need to maintain a send queue now
	(control_open): Change to return an NihIo that uses the default
	control watcher, and our error handler.  Split socket opening into
	(control_open_sock): which can be called from other functions.
	(control_close): Use nih_io_close() to close the socket and free the
	structure in one go.
	(control_reopen): Close the open control socket and open it again
	without destroying the NihIo structure, its queues or state.
	(control_close_handler): Handle the control socket going away
	(control_error_handler): Handle errors on the control socket,
	including the connection refused error that indicates a client went
	away.
	(control_handle): Split this into a miriad of small functions with
	a table to link them to the message type; this will make expanding
	each message handler much easier in future.
	* init/control.h: Update.
	* init/tests/test_control.c: Rewrite test cases to check the new
	handler functions; as a side-effect, this gets rid of the evil giant
	child/parent functions in favour of one test function per handler
	function.

	* upstart/message.c (upstart_message_handle_using): Wrapper function

	* compat/sysv/runlevel.c (main): Set the usage string.
	* compat/sysv/telinit.c (main): Set the usage string.

	* man/Makefile.am: Use install-data-hook and $(man8dir)
	* util/Makefile.am: Also use install-exec-hook

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Install contents of the man directory
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Generate man/Makefile
	* man/Makefile.am: Install manpages in the appropriate places.
	* man/init.8, man/logd.8, man/initctl.8, man/reboot.8,
	* man/shutdown.8, man/start.8, man/sulogin.8, man/runlevel.8,
	* man/telinit.8: Include some basic manpages so we at least have
	some level of documentation.

	* init/job.c (job_child_reaper): Don't check the exit status of
	a respawning job if the goal is to stop it.

	* compat/sysv/telinit.c (main): Generate events rather than
	starting and stopping jobs directly, the events are named
	"runlevel-X".  0, 1, 6 and s/S are shutdown events.

	* logd/main.c (main): Raise SIGSTOP before entering the main loop.
	* init/main.c (main): Interlock with logd.

	* event.d/logd: Should not be a console owner, but should stop
	on shutdown.

	* init/process.c (process_setup_console): Revert part of the previous
	change, should just output to /dev/null if we don't have logd.

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.2.5

	* init/main.c (main): Start the logd job if it exists.

	* init/process.c (process_setup_console): Ignore ECONNREFUSED as

	* init/process.c (process_setup_console): Implement handling for
	CONSOLE_LOGGED and generally clean up the other handling.
	* init/process.h: Update.
	* init/main.c (main): Pass NULL for the job to setup console.
	* TODO: Update.

	* logd/main.c: Implement the logging daemon, it accepts connections
	on a unix stream socket with the abstract name
	"/com/ubuntu/upstart/logd", expects the length of the name and the
	name to follow; then sequences of lines which are logged to
	/var/log/boot, or memory until that file can be opened.

2006-09-08  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* util/shutdown.c (event_setter): Change the event names to
	distinguish between "shutdown -h" and "shutdown -h -H".

	* init/job.c (job_handle_event): Allow jobs to react to their own
	events, this is how we'll do respawn eventually.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_handle_event): Remove test.

	* init/main.c (cad_handler, kbd_handler): Generate the new event
	names.

	* logd/main.c (main): Add the code to daemonise, etc.

2006-09-07  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* TODO: Long discussion today on #upstart, many improvements to the
	job and event model that make it more elegant.
	* AUTHORS: Include a list of thanks.

	* util/shutdown.c (shutdown_now): If we get ECONNREFUSED when we
	try and send the shutdown event to init, it probably means we're
	still in sysvinit.  So try that instead.
	(sysvinit_shutdown): Function to send a hand-crafted runlevel
	change message across /dev/initctl.

	* util/initctl.c (main): Add a shutdown command that takes an
	arbitrary event name to be issued after "shutdown".  You'll
	nearly always want the /sbin/shutdown tool instead.

	* init/job.c (job_detect_idle): Only generate the stalled event
	if at least one job handles it in its start_events list.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_detect_idle): Make sure that works.

	* init/event.h (STARTUP_EVENT, SHUTDOWN_EVENT, STALLED_EVENT):
	Macros to define the standard event names.
	* init/main.c (main): Use STARTUP_EVENT macro instead of "startup"
	* init/control.c (control_handle): Use SHUTDOWN_EVENT macro
	instead of "shutdown".
	* init/job.c (job_detect_idle): Use STALLED_EVENT macro instead
	of "stalled".

	detect the idle or stalled states.
	(job_kill_process, job_kill_timer): Increase log verbosity.
	* init/event.c (event_queue_run): Log which events we're handling
	if --debug is given.

	* compat/sysv/telinit.c (main): Send a shutdown command when
	requesting to enter runlevel 0 or runlevel 6, likewise for
	runlevel 1, s or S which all run "rc1" not "rcS".
	* init/main.c (main): When called directory (pid != 1) try and
	run telinit before complaining that we're not init.  Make sure
	errors aren't lost.

2006-09-04  Johan Kiviniemi  <johan@kiviniemi.name>

	* upstart/control.c (upstart_addr): Replace use of __builtin_offsetof
	with offsetof.
	* upstart/tests/test_control.c (test_recv_msg): Likewise.

2006-09-04  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>
	
	* util/shutdown.c (main): Exit normally after sending the warning
	message if -k is given.

2006-09-01  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.2.2

	* NEWS: Update.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.2.1

	* init/process.c (process_setup_console): Ensure that the console

	other variable.
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_job_stanza, cfg_parse_script, cfg_next_token): 
	Print lineno using %zi not %d
	* compat/sysv/runlevel.c (store): Cast pointer type of timeval.

	* init/main.c: Move the kernel headers include beneath the C
	library ones, so that compilation doesn't fail on !i386.
	* util/reboot.c: Likewise.

	* init/main.c (term_handler): Close the control connection if we
	re-exec init, otherwise it won't be able to bind.  Drop debugging.

	* init/main.c (term_handler): It always helps if we dup2 the
	right file descriptor.

	* init/main.c: Use the TERM signal instead of USR1, as old init
	used that for something else.  Also rather than passing across
	file descriptor numbers, use a fixed descriptor and just pass
	"--restart".  When we get that option we need to unmask signals
	otherwise we sit there looking like a lemon.

	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Don't free the event unless we
	generate one.

	* NEWS: Update.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_watcher): Ignore any file with '.' or '~'

	* TODO: Update.

	* init/main.c (main): Parse command-line arguments, specifically

	* init/job.c (job_read_state, job_write_state): Job state
	serialisation so that we can re-exec ourselves.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_read_job): Fix a bug, need to subtract current
	time to get due time.

	* upstart/job.c (job_goal_from_name, job_state_from_name) 
	(process_state_from_name): Add opposite numbers that convert a
	string back into an enumeration.
	* upstart/job.h: Update.
	* upstart/tests/test_job.c: Test the new functions.

2006-08-31  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/job.h (Job): Add respawn_limit, respawn_interval,
	respawn_count and respawn_time members so that we can keep track of
	runaway processes.
	* init/job.c (job_catch_runaway): Increment the respawn_count
	within respawn_interval, or reset it if we go over.
	(job_new): Initialise respawn_limit and respawn_interval to sensible
	defaults.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Check the defaults are set.

	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Test the new stanza.

	* init/process.c (process_setup_console): Remove the console reset
	code, it tends to just crash X and seems to do nothing interesting.
	* init/main.c (reset_console): Instead put it here and just do it
	on startup.

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.2.0

	* util/Makefile.am (install-exec-local): Create symbolic links,
	not hard links.

	* init/main.c: Can't catch STOP.

	* util/reboot.c: Pause init while shutting down or rebooting.

	* init/main.c (stop_handler): Catch STOP/TSTP and CONT.
	* init/event.c (event_queue_run): Don't run the event queue while
	paused.
	* init/job.c (job_detect_idle): Don't detect idle jobs while paused.

	* util/reboot.c: if we get the -w argument ("only write to wtmp")
	we need to exit, and not behave as halt normally would.

	* compat/sysv/runlevel.c (main): Add missing newline.
	* compat/sysv/telinit.c (main): And here too.

	* init/main.c (main): Check for idle after the startup event queue
	has been run, otherwise we may just sit there.

	* compat/sysv/Makefile.am (sbin_PROGRAMS): Build and install telinit
	(telinit_SOURCES, telinit_LDFLAGS, telinit_LDADD): Details for
	telinit binary.
	* compat/sysv/telinit.c: Trivial telinit program that just runs
	the appropriate rcX job.
	* compat/sysv/runlevel.c (main): Suggest help on illegal runlevel.

	* util/Makefile.am: Tidy up.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Create compat/sysv/Makefile

	* compat/sysv/Makefile.am (sbin_PROGRAMS): Build and install runlevel
	(runlevel_SOURCES, runlevel_LDFLAGS, runlevel_LDADD): Details for
	runlevel binary.

	send the job event when a service is running or a task is stopping.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_change_state): Check the events get
	sent properly.

	* util/start.c: Write a simple utility to start, stop, or query
	the status of the named jobs.
	* util/Makefile.am (sbin_PROGRAMS): Build and install start
	(start_SOURCES, start_LDFLAGS, start_LDADD): Details for start
	(install-exec-local): Also install as stop and status.

	(job_run_command): Likewise.
	* init/control.c (control_send): Likewise.
	* init/cfgfile.c: And throughout this file.
	* upstart/control.c (upstart_recv_msg): And once here too.

	* upstart/control.h: Abolish the separate halt, reboot and poweroff

	name.
	* init/control.c (control_send): Copy the shutdown event name.
	(control_handle): Replace individual handling with the new
	single event.
	* init/tests/test_control.c (test_watcher): Update.
	* util/initctl.c: Drop handling for things that shutdown does now.
	* util/shutdown.c: Send the UPSTART_SHUTDOWN event and let the user
	specify anything they want, just give defaults.

	This is quite a big change and abolishes level events entirely,
	along with the event history.  We now just treat events as a
	transient queue of strings that go past, may cause things to change,
	but are otherwise forgotten.  This turns out to be much easier to
	understand and has no real loss of power.

	* init/event.c: Vastly simplify; gone are the separate notions of
	edge and level events, instead we just treat them as one-shot
	things that go past and are forgotten about.
	* init/event.h (Event): Remove value member.
	Update prototypes.
	* init/tests/test_event.c: Update.
	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Change the event pattern to be

	level events.
	(control_handle_event): Don't include a level in the event.
	* init/tests/test_control.c: Update
	* init/main.c: Call event_queue rather than event_queue_edge.
	* upstart/control.c (upstart_send_msg_to, upstart_recv_msg): Change
	event handling so that only a name is read.
	* upstart/control.h: Remove value/level event structures.
	* upstart/tests/test_control.c (test_messages): Update.
	* upstart/job.c (process_state_name): Not used for events, adjust
	documentation so it doesn't lie.
	* util/initctl.c (main): Drop the set function, simplify trigger.
	* util/shutdown.c (shutdown_now): Call UPSTART_EVENT_QUEUE for
	shutdown into maintenance mode.

	* init/control.c (control_handle): Place a message in the syslog
	before halting, powering off or rebooting.

	* util/shutdown.c: Adjust so that the warning message is sent out
	if shutdown is immediate, and when it actually happens.  Include
	the hostname as wall does.

2006-08-30  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* util/shutdown.c: Implement shutdown utility along the same lines
	as the sysvinit one, but with rather different code.

	* util/initctl.c (main): Call setuid on the effective user id so
	that we can be made setuid root and executable by a special group.
	* util/reboot.c (main): Likewise.

	* util/initctl.c (main): Check the effective rather than the real
	user id, if we're effectively root, that's good enough.

	* util/reboot.c: Implement reboot/halt/poweroff utility.
	* util/Makefile.am (sbin_PROGRAMS): Build and install reboot
	(reboot_SOURCES, reboot_LDFLAGS, reboot_LDADD): Details for reboot

	* init/main.c (main): Actually run the idle-detect function.
	* init/job.c (job_detect_idle): Interrupt the main loop, otherwise
	we may end up waiting for a signal before we process the event
	we just issued.

2006-08-27  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	to kill init.  Handle SIGINT and SIGWINCH through the ordinary
	handler and SIGSEGV through a direct handler.
	(segv_handler): Write a sensible core dump handler, we use a child
	to dump core while we carry on in the parent hopefully stepping over
	the bad instruction.

2006-08-24  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/cfgfile.h (CFG_DIR): Change configuration directory to
	/etc/event.d -- it's not been used by anyone, but is similar to
	other directories that have which is a good precedent.
	* event.d/Makefile.am (eventdir, dist_event_DATA): Install files
	into the new directory name.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Rename sub directory

	performing other actions so errno is not lost.

	* TODO: Update.o
	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_next_token): Don't count quote characters

	* init/tests/test_job.c: Clean up not-freed job.

2006-08-23  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/tests/test_event.c: free the entry allocated and initialise
	the return values.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_skip_token): Drop this function; we'll
	make sure *pos is pointing at the start of the thing we want
	to parse, not the first token.  Update the other functions
	accordingly.
	(cfg_read_job): Implement function to look over a job file and
	parse all of the stanzas that are found.  Also sanity checks the
	job afterwards and deals with reloading existing jobs.
	(cfg_job_stanza): Function that parses an individual stanza,
	calling out to the other parse functions; this is the main config
	file parser!

	we've already done so.

	When hitting EOF, return the script so far, not NULL.
	(cfg_parse_args): Correct bug where we didn't check sufficient
	characters while skipping whitespace.
	(cfg_next_token): Correct bug where we didn't copy the character
	after a slash into the text, instead of just not copying the slash.

	* init/tests/test_cfgfile.c (test_read_job): Pretty thoroughly

	(cfg_script_end): Pass and increment lineno.

	* init/cfgfile.c: Correct a missing semi-colon in prototypes.
	(cfg_parse_command): Function to parse any stanza that requires
	a command and arguments list, e.g. exec/respawn/daemon.  We don't
	want to require that the list be quoted, etc. and do want to allow
	it to be folded over lines.
	(cfg_tokenise): Function used by the above to tokenise the file,
	handling things like \, quoted strings and newlines, etc.  Can be
	used both to determine the length of the token and to copy it.

	* init/cfgfile.c (cfg_read_script): Function to parse a script
	fragment ("foo script\n....end script\n") from the job file, which
	is the most complex form we can find.  Write it assuming the file is
	in a character array which may not be NULL terminated (ie. a mmap'd
	file).
	(cfg_script_end): Used by the above to detect the end of the
	fragment.
	* init/cfgfile.h: Empty header file.
	* init/Makefile.am (init_SOURCES): Build and link cfgfile.c

	condition does the right thing.
	
	* init/job.c (job_change_state): Make it illegal for a job to exist

	we've just outlawed.

	* init/job.c (job_start): Only announce the change if we're still

	state.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_next_state): Adjust test case.

	* init/control.c (control_subscribe): Allow the current
	subscription to be found by passing NOTIFY_NONE.

	a race that upsets gdb, have tried this with a STOP/CONT interlock
	but can't seem to find where the child should reach first.

	(UpstartUnwatchEventsMsg): Add structures for the new messages.
	(UpstartMsg): And add them to the union.

2006-08-09  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/job.h: Header file to contain the definition of the Job

	(JobGoal): In a divergence from the specification, we introduced a
	"goal" for a job which tells us which way round the state machine
	we're going (towards start, or towards stop).
	(JobState): Which means this always holds the current state, even
	if we're trying to get out of this state (ie. if we've sent the TERM
	signal to the running process, we're still in the running state until
	it's actually been reaped).

	process so we know whether we need to force a state transition or
	can just expect one because something transient is happening.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Function to allocate a Job structure, set
	the pointers to NULL and other important members to sensible
	defaults.
	(job_init): Initialise the list of jobs.
