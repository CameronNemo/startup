	* init/process.c (process_spawn): Spawn a process using the job
	details to set up the environment, etc.
	(process_setup_console): Set up the console according to the job.
	(process_setup_limits): Set up the limits according to the job.
	(process_setup_environment): Set up the environment according to
	the job.
	(process_kill): Simple function to send a kill signal or raise an
	error; mostly just a wrapper without any particular logic.
	* init/process.h: Prototypes and macros.
	* init/tests/test_process.c: Test cases.
	* init/Makefile.am (init_SOURCES): Build and link process.c and
	its header file.
	(TESTS): Run the process test suite.
	(test_process_SOURCES, test_process_LDFLAGS, test_process_LDADD):
	Details for process test sutie binary.

	* init/job.c (job_new): nih_list_free is necessary.
	* init/tests/test_job.c (test_new): Free job when done.

	* init/job.h: Header file to contain the definition of the Job
	structure and associated typedefs, etc.
	(JobGoal): In a divergence from the specification, we introduced a
	"goal" for a job which tells us which way round the state machine
	we're going (towards start, or towards stop).
	(JobState): Which means this always holds the current state, even
	if we're trying to get out of this state (ie. if we've sent the TERM
	signal to the running process, we're still in the running state until
	it's actually been reaped).
	(ProcessState): And in another divergence, we keep the state of the
	process so we know whether we need to force a state transition or
	can just expect one because something transient is happening.
	* init/job.c (job_new): Function to allocate a Job structure, set
	the pointers to NULL and other important members to sensible
	defaults.
	(job_init): Initialise the list of jobs.
	* init/tests/test_job.c: Test suite.
	* init/Makefile.am (init_SOURCES): Compile and link job.c using
	its header file.
	(TESTS): Run the job test suite.
	(test_job_SOURCES, test_job_LDFLAGS, test_job_LDADD): Details for the
	job test suite binary.

	* HACKING: Document dependency on libnih.

2006-07-27  Scott James Remnant  <scott@netsplit.com>

	* init/Makefile.am (DEFS): Append to the default DEFS list, rather
	than overriding, otherwise we lose HAVE_CONFIG_H
