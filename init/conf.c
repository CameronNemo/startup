 *
 * The returned structure is automatically placed in the conf_sources hash

 *
 * Configuration is not parsed immediately, instead you must call

 * this is called once after setting up all sources.
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another allocated
 * block which will be used as the parent for this block.  When @parent

 * that would need to be run, you can assign a destructor function using
 * the nih_alloc_set_destructor() function.
