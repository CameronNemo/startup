/**
 * process_spawn:
 * @job: job context for process to be spawned in,

 * This function spawns a new process using the @job details to set up the

 * leader as we never want anything in our own group.
 *
 * The process to be executed is given in the @argv array which is passed
 * directly to execvp(), so should be in the same NULL-terminated form with
 * the first argument containing the path or filename of the binary.  The
 * PATH environment in @job will be searched.
 *
 * This function only spawns the process, it is up to the caller to ensure
 * that the information is saved into the job and the process is watched, etc.
 *
 * Spawning a process may fail for temporary reasons, usually due to a failure
 * of the fork() syscall or communication with the child; or more permanent
 * reasons such as a failure to setup the child environment.  These latter
 * are always represented by a PROCESS_ERROR error.
