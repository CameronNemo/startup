/**
 * process_spawn:
 * @job: job context for process to be spawned in,
 * @argv: %NULL-terminated list of arguments for the process.
 *
 * This function spawns a new process using the @job details to set up the
 * environment for it; the process is always a session and process group
 * leader as we never want anything in our own group.
 *
 * The process to be executed is given in the @argv array which is passed
 * directly to #execvp, so should be in the same %NULL-terminated form with
 * the first argument containing the path or filename of the binary.  The
 * PATH environment for the job will be searched.
 *
 * This function only spawns the process, it is up to the caller to ensure
 * that the information is saved into the job and the process is watched, etc.
 *
 * Note that the only error raised within this function is a failure of the
 * #fork syscall as the environment is set up within the child process.
 *
 * Returns: process id of new process on success, -1 on raised error
