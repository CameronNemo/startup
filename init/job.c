 * directly using exec after splitting on whitespace.
 *
 * When exectued with the shell, if the command (which may be an entire

 * to read commands from one of the special /dev/fd/NN devices and NihIo
 * used to feed the script into that device.  A pointer to the NihIo object
 * is not kept or stored because it will automatically clean itself up should
 * the script go away as the other end of the pipe will be closed.
 *
 * In either case the shell is run with the -e option so that commands will
 * fail if their exit status is not checked.
 *
 * No error is returned from this function because it will block until
 * the process_spawn() calls succeeds, that can only fail for temporary
 * reasons (such as a lack of process ids) which would cause problems
