/**
 * job_run_process:

 * pid in that table entry.
 *
 * The process is normally executed using the system shell, unless the
 * script member of @process is FALSE and there are no typical shell
 * characters within the command member, in which case it is executed
 * directly using exec after splitting on whitespace.
 *
 * When exectued with the shell, if the command (which may be an entire
 * script) is reasonably small (less than 1KB) it is passed to the
 * shell using the POSIX-specified -c option.  Otherwise the shell is told
 * to read commands from one of the special /dev/fd/NN devices and NihIo
 * used to feed the script into that device.  A pointer to the NihIo object
 * is not kept or stored because it will automatically clean itself up should
 * the script go away as the other end of the pipe will be closed.
 *
 * In either case the shell is run with the -e option so that commands will
 * fail if their exit status is not checked.
 *
 * This function will block until the process_spawn() call succeeds or
 * a non-temporary error occurs (such as file not found).  It is up to the
 * called to decide whether non-temporary errors are a reason to change the
 * job state or not.
