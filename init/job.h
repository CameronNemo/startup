 * Job:
 * @entry: list header,
 * @name: string name of the job; namespace shared with events,
 * @description: description of the job; intended for humans,
 * @author: author of the job; intended for humans,
 * @version: version of the job; intended for humans,
 * @goal: whether the job is to be stopped or started,
 * @state: actual state of the job,
 * @pid: current process id,
 * @cause: cause of last goal change,
 * @failed: whether the last process ran failed,
 * @failed_state: state the job was in for the last failed process,
 * @exit_status: exit status of the last failed process,
 * @start_events: list of events that can start this job,
 * @stop_events; list of events that can stop this job.
 * @emits: list of additional events that this job can emit,
 * @kill_timeout: time to wait between sending TERM and KILL signals,
 * @kill_timer: timer to kill process,
 * @spawns_instance: job is always waiting and spawns instances,
 * @is_instance: job should be cleaned up instead of waiting,
 * @service: job has reached its goal when running,
 * @respawn: process should be restarted if it fails,
 * @respawn_limit: number of respawns in @respawn_interval that we permit,
 * @respawn_interval: barrier for @respawn_limit,

 * except for the handling when the main process terminates, they are both
 * collated together in this structure and only differ in the value of the
 * @respawn member.
