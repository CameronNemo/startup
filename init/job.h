 * Job:
 * @entry: list header,

 * @author: author of the job; intended for humans,
 * @version: version of the job; intended for humans,
 * @goal: whether the job is to be stopped or started,
 * @state: actual state of the job,
 * @start_events: list of events that can start this job,
 * @stop_events; list of events that can stop this job.
 * @process_state: what we're waiting for from the process,
 * @pid: current process id,
 * @kill_timeout: time to wait between sending TERM and KILL signals,
 * @kill_timer: timer to kill process,
 * @spawns_instance: job is always waiting and spawns instances,
 * @is_instance: job should be cleaned up instead of waiting,
 * @respawn: process should be restarted if it fails,
 * @normalexit: array of exit codes that prevent a respawn,
 * @normalexit_len: length of @normalexit array,
 * @daemon: process forks into background; pid needs to be obtained,
 * @pidfile: obtain pid by reading this file,
 * @binary: obtain pid by locating this binary,
 * @pid_timeout: time to wait before giving up obtaining pid,
 * @pid_timer: timer for pid location,
 * @command: command to be run as the primary process,
 * @script: script to run instead of @command,
 * @start_script: script to run before @command is started,
 * @stop_script: script to run after @command is stopped,
 * @respawn_script: script to run between @command respawns,
 * @console: how to arrange the job's stdin/out/err file descriptors,
 * @env: %NULL-terminated list of environment strings to set,
 * @umask: file mode creation mask,
 * @nice: process priority,
 * @limits: resource limits indexed by resource,
 * @chroot: root directory of process (implies @chdir if not set),
 * @chdir: working directory of process,
 *
 * This structure represents a known task or service that should be tracked
 * by the init daemon; as tasks and services are fundamentally identical,
 * except for the handling when the main process terminates, they are both
 * collated together in this structure and only differ in the value of the
 * @respawn member.
