/**
 * Event:
 * @entry: list header,
 * @name: string name of the event; namespace shared with jobs,
 * @value: current or expected value for level events.
 *
 * We talk about two types of events, level events which have a @value
 * associated and edge events which do not (@value is %NULL).  The change
 * of any level event's @value is also considered an edge event.
 *
 * This structure is used within the event code to hold a record of previously
 * triggered edge events and the current value of level events; it is also
 * used within the job code to hold the list of events a job is waiting for.
