/**
 * job_process_spawn:
 * @class: job class of process to be spawned,
 * @argv: NULL-terminated list of arguments for the process,
 * @env: NULL-terminated list of environment variables for the process,
 * @trace: whether to trace this process.
 *
 * This function spawns a new process using the @class details to set up the
 * environment for it; the process is always a session and process group
 * leader as we never want anything in our own group.
 *
 * The process to be executed is given in the @argv array which is passed
 * directly to execvp(), so should be in the same NULL-terminated form with
 * the first argument containing the path or filename of the binary.  The
 * PATH environment in @config will be searched.
 *
 * If @trace is TRUE, the process will be traced with ptrace and this will
 * cause the process to be stopped when the exec() call is made.  You must
 * wait for this and then may use it to set options before continuing the
 * process.
 *
 * This function only spawns the process, it is up to the caller to ensure
 * that the information is saved into the job and that the process is watched,
 * etc.
 *
 * Spawning a process may fail for temporary reasons, usually due to a failure
 * of the fork() syscall or communication with the child; or more permanent
 * reasons such as a failure to setup the child environment.  These latter
 * are always represented by a JOB_PROCESS_ERROR error.
 *
 * Returns: process id of new process on success, -1 on raised error
