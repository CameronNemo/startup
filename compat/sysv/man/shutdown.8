.TH shutdown 8 "March 2007" "Upstart"
.\"
.SH NAME
shutdown \- bring the system down
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBshutdown\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fITIME\fR [\fIMESSAGE\fR]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shutdown
arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All logged-in
users are notified that the system is going down and, within the last
five minutes of
.IR TIME ,
new logins are prevented.

.I TIME
may have different formats, the most common is simply the word
.RI ' now '
which will bring the system down immediately.  Other valid formats are
.IR +m ,
where
.I m
is the number of minutes to wait until shutting down and
.I hh:mm
which specifies the time on the 24hr clock.

Once
.I TIME
has elapsed,
.B shutdown
sends a request to the
.BR init (8)
daemon to bring the system down into the appropriate runlevel.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -r
Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down.
.\"
.TP
.BR -h
Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been
brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system.
.\"
.TP
.BR -H
Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down.
.\"
.TP
.BR -P
Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down.
.\"
.TP
.BR -c
Cancels a running shutdown.
.I TIME
is not specified with this option, the first argument is
.I MESSAGE.
.\"
.TP
.BR -k
Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually
bring the system down.
.\"
.SH NOTES
This tool is provided for compatibility with the traditional System V
.BR init (8).
Upstart has no notion of runlevels itself, this and the
.BR telinit (8)
tool are provided to emulate their behaviour.

When invoked it generates a
.I runlevel
event, with an argument containing the new runlevel.
