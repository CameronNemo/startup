 * A node without any parent (root node) has @parent set to NULL, nodes
 * without any children (leaf nodes) have @left and @right set to NULL.

 * NihTree is most useful for implementing pure binary trees, where the

 *
 * General trees (where each node may have zero or more nodes, beyond two)
 * can be implemented using binary trees as described by Knuth (fundamentally,
 * head right for siblings, left for children) or as lists of children in
 * each node (such as used by nih_alloc); pick whichever suits your data
