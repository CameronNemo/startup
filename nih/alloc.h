/**
 * NihAllocator:
 * @ptr: pointer to be reallocated,
 * @size: size of allocation.
 *
 * An allocator is a function that can be used to both allocate memory
 * and return it to the system (or cache it, etc.)  The behaviour should
 * be the same of that as the standard realloc() function.

/**
 * NihDestructor:
 * @ptr: pointer to be destroyed.
 *
 * A destructor is a function that can be associated with an allocated
 * block of memory and is called when the block is freed; the pointer
 * given is that of the block being freed.
 *
 * This can be used, for example, to close a file descriptor when the
 * structure for it is being closed.

/**
 * nih_new:
 * @parent: parent block for new allocation,
 * @type: type of data to store.
 *
 * Allocates a block of memory large enough to store a @type object and
 * returns a pointer to it.
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another allocated
 * block which will be used as the parent for this block.  When @parent
 * is freed, the returned block will be freed too.  If you have clean-up
 * that would need to be run, you can assign a destructor function using
 * the nih_alloc_set_destructor() function.
 *
 * Returns: requested memory block.
