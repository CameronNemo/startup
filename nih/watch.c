/**
 * nih_watch_new:
 * @parent: parent of new structure,
 * @path: full path to be watched,
 * @subdirs: include sub-directories of @path,
 * @create: call @create_handler for existing files,
 * @filter: function to filter paths watched,
 * @create_handler: function called when a path is created,
 * @modify_handler; function called when a path is modified,
 * @delete_handler: function called when a path is deleted,
 * @data: pointer to pass to functions.
 *
 * Watches @path for changes, which may be either a single file or a
 * directory.  If @path is a directory, then sub-directories can be included
 * by setting @subdirs to TRUE; both existing and newly created
 * sub-directories will be automatically watched.
 *
 * Additionally, the set of files and directories within @path can be
 * limited by passing a @filter function which will recieve the paths and
 * may return TRUE to indicate that the path received should not be watched.
 *
 * When a file is created within @path, or moved from outside this location
 * into it, @create_handler will be called.  If @path is removed, or a file
 * is removed within @path, or moved to a location outside it,
 * @delete_handler will be called.  Finally if @path is modified, or a file
 * within it is modified, @modify_handler will be called.
 *
 * If @create is TRUE, @create_handler will also be called for all of the
 * files that exist under @path when the watch is first added.  This only
 * occurs if the watch can be added.
 *
 * This is a very high level wrapped around the inotify API; lower levels
 * can be obtained using the inotify API itself and some of the helper
 * functions used by this one.
 *
 * The returned watch structure is allocated with nih_alloc(), and contains
 * open inotify descriptors and child structures including NihIo.  It should
 * be freed using nih_watch_free().
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another allocated
 * block which will be used as the parent for this block.  When @parent
 * is freed, the returned string will be freed too.  If you have clean-up
 * that would need to be run, you can assign a destructor function using
 * the nih_alloc_set_destructor() function.
 *
 * Returns: new NihWatch structure, or NULL on raised error.
