	/* This is somewhat more difficult than alloc or free because we

	 *
	 * The problem is that references in the parent to this ptr's list
	 * entry or references in children to this ptr's children list
	 * entry are invalid once the allocator has been called.
	 *
	 * We could strip it all down before the allocator, then rebuild it
	 * afterwards, but that's expensive and could be error-prone in the
	 * case where the allocator fails.
	 *
	 * The solution is to rely on a property of nih_list_add(); the
	 * entry passed (to be added) is cut out of its containing list
	 * without deferencing the return pointers, this means we can cut
	 * the bad pointers out simply by calling nih_list_add() to put the
	 * new entry back in the same position.
	 *
	 * Of course, this only works in the non-empty list case as trying
	 * to cut an entry out of an empty list would deference those
	 * invalid pointers.  Happily all we need to do for the non-empty
	 * list case is call nih_list_init() again.
	 *
	 * For the primary list entry this is if we don't have a parent.
	 * For the children list entry, this is if we don't have children,
	 * which is difficult to detect after the allocator has been
	 * called.  The easiest thing to do is stash a pointer to the first
	 * child, if non-NULL then we use it for nih_list_add(), if NULL
	 * then we call nih_list_init().
