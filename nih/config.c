 * nih_config_has_token:

 *
 * Checks the current position in @file to see whether it has a parseable

 * current character is neither a comment or newline character.
 *
 * If this returns FALSE, it's normal to call nih_config_skip_comment()

 *
 * @file may be a memory mapped file, in which case @pos should be given

 * @pos is used as the offset within @file to begin, otherwise the start
