 * The watch structure is allocated using nih_alloc() and stored in a linked

 * Removal of the watch can be performed by freeing it.
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another allocated
 * block which will be used as the parent for this block.  When @parent
 * is freed, the returned string will be freed too.  If you have clean-up
