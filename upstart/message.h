 * with additional arguments that vary based on @type as follows:
 *
 * UPSTART_JOB_START:
 * UPSTART_JOB_STOP:
 * UPSTART_JOB_QUERY:
 * @name: name of job to start, stop or query the status of (char *).
 *
 * UPSTART_JOB_UNKNOWN:
 * @name: unknown job name (char *).
 *
 * UPSTART_JOB_STATUS:
 * @name: name of job (char *),
 * @goal: current goal (JobGoal),
 * @state: state of job (JobState),
 * @process_state: state of current process (ProcessState),
 * @pid: process id (pid_t),
 * @description: description of job (char *).
 *
 * All other types receive no further arguments.
 *
 * Returns: zero on success, negative value on raised error.
