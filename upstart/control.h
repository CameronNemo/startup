 * Each has an associated structure which contains additional data passed
 * with the message, the structure is named by converting the type name to
 * CamelCase and appending Msg on the end; e.g. the struct for the fictional
 * UPSTART_FOO_BAR message sould be UpstartFooBarMsg.
 *
 * Most are only appropriate in one direction, see the documentation for the
