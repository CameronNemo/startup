/**
 * JobGoal:
 *
 * There are two ultimate goals for any job, either it should be stopped
 * or it should be started.  In order to achieve these goals, we may need
 * to go through a number of different states, and even the processes
 * involved may need to go through different states.
 *
 * A typical example might be changing the goal of a process that is active
 * in the running state from start to stop; the actual activities and state
 * changes for that are:
 * - send process the TERM signal, set process state to killed
 * - wait for process to die, possibly send KILL signal
 * - change state to stopping, spawn the stop script and set process state
 *   to active
 * - wait for script to terminate
 * - change state to waiting and process state to none
