.SH DESCRIPTION
.B initctl
allows a system administrator to communication with the
.BR init (8)
daemon and perform various actions depending on
.IR COMMAND .

Normally it is invoked directly with the command specified as the first
non-option argument, however symbolic or hard links may be used so that
it is invoked as the name of a command, in which case it behaves
accordingly.
