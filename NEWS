0.2.6  2006-09-13

	* Fix major bug on architectures with 64-bit kernel and 32-bit
	  user-land caused by an inconsitency between the behaviour of
	  kernel's compat_sys_waitid() vs. sys_waitid() functions.

	* "halt" now only calls "shutdown -h now"

0.2.5  2006-09-09

	* "control-alt-delete" event name changed to "ctrlaltdel".

	* "initctl shutdown EVENT" added that performs the same job as
	  "shutdown" but without all the usual warnings, timings, etc.

	* "logd" has now been written, if installed this is started by init
	  before sending the "startup" call and all jobs with "console logged"
	  (the default) will have their output sent to this daemon.  It
	  currently just logs to /var/log/boot.

	* "shutdown -k" implemented.

	* The "shutdown" utility has been changed to generate "system-halt"
	  for "-H", "power-off" for "-P" and just "halt" if only "-h" given.

	* If "shutdown" is run when running under sysvinit, it will now
	  send the appropriate /dev/initctl message to allow upgrades.

	* "telinit S" implemented.

	* Instead of trying to start or stop jobs, "telinit" now just sends
	  "runlevel-X" events.

	* The "telinit" utility now ensures a "shutdown" event is sent
	  before switching to runlevel 0, 1 or 6.

	* If "telinit" is installed and init is called by the super-user,
	  "telinit" is invoked instead.

	* Basic manual pages included.

0.2.1  2006-09-01

	* Compilation fixes

0.2.0  2006-09-01

	* "shutdown", "reboot", "halt" and "poweroff" utilities provided
	  that match their traditional equivalents.

	* "start", "stop" and "status" utilities provided to start, stop
	  and query the status of jobs respectively.

	* "runlevel" and "telinit" utilities provided for compatibility.

	* "initctl list" will list active jobs.

	* Events vastly simplified to just simple strings.

	* Jobs now generate "jobname/start", "jobname/started",
	  "jobname/stop" and "jobname/stopped" events as they go through
	  state transitions.

	* Services generate a "jobname" event when they are running.

	* Tasks generate a "jobname" event when they have finished.

	* The "shutdown" utility will generate a "shutdown" event followed
	  by one of "maintenance", "reboot", "halt" or "poweroff" or any
	  admin-specified event.

	* "stalled" event generated when no jobs are running or queued.

	* "control-alt-delete" event generated when that key combination
	  is pressed

	* "kbdrequest" event generated when Alt-UpArrow is pressed

	* Runaway respawning services will now be caught.

	* init will re-exec on receipt of the SIGUSR1 signal.
