  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * debian/conf/failsafe.conf: instead of waiting for the 'runlevel' event
    before considering failsafe done, stop this job as soon as we're
    starting rc-sysinit; that way, any delays in /etc/rcS.d will not cause
    confusing messages about networking delays when the network is not the
    problem. (LP: #950662)

    early job log output data when disk becomes writeable.
  * Re-enable job logging by default.

    check for unexpected open fds, so that files leaked from the environment
    don't cause the test suite to fail gratuitously.  LP: #926473.
  * bump debhelper compat to 9 and adjust debian/rules to use the
    dpkg-buildflags interfaces, so that upstart can be cross-compiled and
    also so we pick up any future hardening flags for free.

    a previously built copy of nih-dbus-tool, especially useful when
    cross-compiling.  LP: #426740.
  * Merge change from libnih to store our assertion messages in the

    "fake" start jobs of those names.  Basically this means that "status"

    of the job and sends it the HUP signal.  LP: #433544.

      the job is already running using upstart status, and if so return success.
    - same for the stop command: return success if the job is already stopped.
    - when $DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE is set, don't spit warnings out because

    current dpkg behaviour wrt obsolete conffiles.  The conffile is now moved
    out of the way in preinst and the moved file deleted in postinst, or moved

    already either of those two values.  That way we don't end up with

    between releases.

  * Adjust the rcS-sulogin job so that if sulogin exits the default runlevel
    is entered; but if the job is stopped (e.g. by shutdown) it isn't.  The
    solves the regression introduced in the previous release.

  * Revert upstream logd/"quiet" change in favour of doing it in our

    to /var/log/boot.

  * Add /etc/event.d/rc0 that is run on the "halt" event (neither -H or -P
    given), and modify rc0-halt to run on "system-halt" (-H given) and
    rc0-poweroff to run on "power-off" (-P given).  Ubuntu: #59134.

    that it's triggered properly.  Ubuntu: #59398.
  * Fix single-user mode.

upstart (0.2.1-7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove the Essential tags again, they didn't solve the problem we
    hoped they would (dpkg/apt still won't remove sysvinit without
    serious persuasion) and I don't think these packages should be.

upstart (0.2.1-6) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make packages Essential, and change Depends to Pre-Depends so that the
    packages work when unconfigured (nothing interesting is performed in
    postinst).  Ubuntu: #59005.
  * Sync priority in debian/control with that in the archive (required)
  * Drop warning of dire consequences if you install upstart, seeing as it's
    installed by default.

  * Add new startup-tasks and system-services packages which will contain
    the /etc/event.d files themselves (other than the main ones).
  * Move tty definitions into system-services.
  * Modify tty definitions to start when the rcS task has finished.  This
    puts them in the "right" place when compared to gdm.  Ubuntu: #58630.

  * Correct rcS compatibility script to ignore any information in utmp so
    that all scripts are always run.  Ubuntu: #59203.
  * Make rcS the console owner while it runs, temporary fix for
    Ubuntu: #58609, #58794, #58796
  * Include default control-alt-delete handler that reboots the machine.

  * upstart-compat-sysv Depends: initscripts (closes: Malone #58979).

upstart (0.2.1-4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add missing #! line to top of postrm

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  4 Sep 2006 08:11:16 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove the rc0 configuration file shipped in 0.1.0 that causes all
    reboots to become shutdowns.  Ubuntu: #58557.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sun,  3 Sep 2006 23:24:41 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't send the SIGTERM signal unless we're upgrading from a version
    of upstart that supports re-exec; older versions would cause a kernel
    PANIC and change from sysvinit does nothing.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sat,  2 Sep 2006 17:18:38 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-1) edgy; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:

  * New upstream release:
    - upstart includes shutdown, reboot, halt, poweroff, start, stop, status,
      runlevel and telinit utilities.
    - "initctl list" will list active jobs.
    - Events vastly simplified to just simple strings.
  
  * Compatibility tasks for old rc scripts, along with runlevel and telinit
    utilities now shipped in upstart-compat-sysv package.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  1 Sep 2006 02:38:44 +0100

upstart (0.1.1-1) edgy; urgency=low

upstart (0.1.0-2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Oops, rename /sbin/init to /sbin/upstart as documented.  Lost this
    while battling bzr.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 24 Aug 2006 16:30:54 +0200

upstart (0.1.0-1) edgy; urgency=low
