upstart (0.2.1-7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove the Essential tags again, they didn't solve the problem we
    hoped they would (dpkg/apt still won't remove sysvinit without
    serious persuasion) and I don't think these packages should be.

upstart (0.2.1-6) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make packages Essential, and change Depends to Pre-Depends so that the
    packages work when unconfigured (nothing interesting is performed in
    postinst).  Ubuntu: #59005.
  * Sync priority in debian/control with that in the archive (required)
  * Drop warning of dire consequences if you install upstart, seeing as it's
    installed by default.

  * Add new startup-tasks and system-services packages which will contain
    the /etc/event.d files themselves (other than the main ones).
  * Move tty definitions into system-services.
  * Modify tty definitions to start when the rcS task has finished.  This
    puts them in the "right" place when compared to gdm.  Ubuntu: #58630.

  * Correct rcS compatibility script to ignore any information in utmp so
    that all scripts are always run.  Ubuntu: #59203.
  * Make rcS the console owner while it runs, temporary fix for
    Ubuntu: #58609, #58794, #58796
  * Include default control-alt-delete handler that reboots the machine.

upstart (0.2.1-3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove the rc0 configuration file shipped in 0.1.0 that causes all
    reboots to become shutdowns.  Ubuntu: #58557.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sun,  3 Sep 2006 23:24:41 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't send the SIGTERM signal unless we're upgrading from a version
    of upstart that supports re-exec; older versions would cause a kernel
    PANIC and change from sysvinit does nothing.
