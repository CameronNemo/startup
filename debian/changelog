upstart (0.2.0-1) edgy; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - upstart includes shutdown, reboot, halt, poweroff, start, stop, status,
      runlevel and telinit utilities.
    - "initctl list" will list active jobs.
    - Events vastly simplified to just simple strings.
  
  * Compatibility tasks for old rc scripts, along with runlevel and telinit
    utilities now shipped in upstart-compat-sysv package.
