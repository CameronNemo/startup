upstart (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New major upstream release. Closes: #530348
  * Remove patches that have been merged upstream or are obsolete
    - debian/patches/01-limits.patch
    - debian/patches/02-telinit-u.patch
    - debian/patches/03-static-convenience-libs.patch
  * Add Build-Depends on pkg-config (>= 0.22), libdbus-1-dev (>= 1.2.16) and
    libexpat1-dev (>= 2.0.0). D-Bus has replaced the home-grown IPC.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2. No further changes.
  * debian/copyright
    - Update copyright years.
    - Clarify license text, Upstart is GPL-2 only.
    - Refer to the versioned GPL-2 document.
  * Drop upstart-logd package. The logd daemon has been buggy for quite a
    while and thus removed completely upstream.
  * debian/upstart.postinst
    - Use "telinit u" to tell init to re-exec itself.
  * debian/rules
    - Remove obsolete configure flag.
    - Use dh_install instead of copying the job files around manually.
  * Merge the upstart-compat-sysv, startup-tasks and system-services package
    into a single upstart package to avoid any unnecessary diversion between
    the Debian and Ubuntu packaging.
  * The location of the job files has changed from /etc/event.d to /etc/init,
    in addition a *.conf suffix is now mandatory.
  * Install rc.conf, rc-sysinit.conf, rcS.conf and control-alt-delete.conf as
    provided by upstream.
  * debian/conf/*.conf
    - Update tty job files for the new job syntax. Add a description and
      author field.
    - Add dbus-reconnect.conf which tells Upstart to reconnect to the D-Bus
      system bus when runlevel 2345 has been reached.
  * Update debian/upstart.install to reflect the changes above.
  * Drop debian/upstart.dirs, obsolete.
  * debian/README.Debian
    - Sync relevant changes from the latest Ubuntu package.
    - Remove outdated information.
  * Add initial support for upstart-job.
    upstart-job is both a virtual package and also small helper utility which
    allows to execute native upstart jobs while preserving the legacy sysv
    "/etc/init.d/<service> <action>" interface.

upstart (0.3.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1. No further changes.
    - Update Vcs-* fields. Package is now managed with Git on git.debian.org.

  * debian/compat
    - Bump debhelper compat level to 7.

    - Move $(QUILT_STAMPFN) dependency to config.status to avoid potential
      issues with parallel make.
  * debian/upstart-compat-sysv.preinst
    - Remove obsolete conffiles also on (re)install.
  * debian/patches/01-limits.patch

upstart (0.2.7-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ martin f. krafft ]
  * Set priority to extra.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Upload to experimental as we conflict with sysvinit which is essential.
  * Sync with Ubuntu.
  * debian/patches/10_inotify.dpatch
    - Removed, merged upstream.
  * system-services: Removed unversioned dependency on util-linux. This
    package is marked Essential and so installed anyway.

    includes the real one.
  * Ensure that the same version of upstart is installed as the version of
    upstart-compat-sysv and upstart-logd; as the IPC protocol may change
    between releases.

    - no longer spins when no stalled event handler.  Ubuntu: #59170.
    - shutdown works when under sysvinit.  Ubuntu: #58523;
    - shutdown -k implemented.  Ubuntu: #58723.
    - telinit sends shutdown event for 0, 1 and 6.  Ubuntu: #58913.
    - basic manual pages included.  Ubuntu: #58724.

  * upstart-compat-sysv Replaces: sysvinit.  Ubuntu: #59427.

    output of jobs with "console logged" (the default) in their description
    to /var/log/boot.

  * Add /etc/event.d/rc0 that is run on the "halt" event (neither -H or -P
    given), and modify rc0-halt to run on "system-halt" (-H given) and
    rc0-poweroff to run on "power-off" (-P given).  Ubuntu: #59134.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 05:10:12 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove the Essential tags again, they didn't solve the problem we
    hoped they would (dpkg/apt still won't remove sysvinit without
    serious persuasion) and I don't think these packages should be.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 02:42:33 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-6) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make packages Essential, and change Depends to Pre-Depends so that the
    packages work when unconfigured (nothing interesting is performed in
    postinst).  Ubuntu: #59005.
  * Sync priority in debian/control with that in the archive (required)
  * Drop warning of dire consequences if you install upstart, seeing as it's
    installed by default.

  * Add new startup-tasks and system-services packages which will contain
    the /etc/event.d files themselves (other than the main ones).
  * Move tty definitions into system-services.
  * Modify tty definitions to start when the rcS task has finished.  This
    puts them in the "right" place when compared to gdm.  Ubuntu: #58630.

  * Correct rcS compatibility script to ignore any information in utmp so
    that all scripts are always run.  Ubuntu: #59203.
  * Make rcS the console owner while it runs, temporary fix for
    Ubuntu: #58609, #58794, #58796
  * Include default control-alt-delete handler that reboots the machine.

    reboots to become shutdowns.  Ubuntu: #58557.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sun,  3 Sep 2006 23:24:41 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't send the SIGTERM signal unless we're upgrading from a version
    of upstart that supports re-exec; older versions would cause a kernel
    PANIC and change from sysvinit does nothing.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Sat,  2 Sep 2006 17:18:38 +0100

upstart (0.2.1-1) edgy; urgency=low
