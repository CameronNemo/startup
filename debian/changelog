upstart (1.13.2-0ubuntu21) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: Relax assertion about output format of
    "dd", as it changed recently. Fixes test failure and FTBFS.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: Disable "exited with signal" check in "with
    single-line script that is killed" test, as this is racy: it is possible
    that a short lived process exits faster than we manage to kill it. This
    will enable us to un-ignore autopkgtests again.

    - drop changes to init/job_class.[ch] process priority handling in favor
      of upstream version.
  * Pull in Ubuntu packaging changes:
    - add INIT_VERBOSE to rc*.conf, overlooked in the previous merge.
    - call dh-autoreconf, adding build-depends on dh-autoreconf and autopoint.
    - update debian/copyright.
    - add upstart-monitor package.
    - migrate to python3.
    - use "serial-tests" harness during build, instead of automake1.13's
      default "parallel-tests" harness; and build-depend on automake
      (>= 1.12) for this interface.
    - Enable parallel build.
    - Enable initial autopkgtests, just doing a package build and rerunning
      the test suite.
    - Add upstart-dconf-bridge package.
    - Silence running-in-container when called from apparmor-profile-load.
    - Hard-code a dependency on libjson0 (>= 0.10-1.2), the first version of
      the package that installs to /lib instead of /usr/lib.
    - Add postinst to handle stateful reexec on upgrade, and depend on
      debianutils for ischroot(1).
    - Add libupstart1 and libupstart1-dev packages.
    - debian/manpages/upstart-events.7: Update for Session Init events.
    - use verbose build (disable silent rules) by default.
    - disable upstream build-time abi check.
    - don't install upstart-event-bridge or upstart-dconf bridge jobs.
    - install an apport hook.
    - debian/source/options: Ignore gmo files we rebuild anyway.
    - include changes to debian/upstart-job, which in practice should never
      be used in Debian.
    - init/apparmor.c: do not load apparmor if running in a container or a
      live cd.
    - init/job_process.c: don't fail if the security profile failed to load.
    - drop no longer used util/tests/test_user_sessions.sh.
  * For now, do not pull in packaging changes to include upstart user
    sessions.
  * Reorder the postinst to avoid calling initctl from a chroot on upgrade,
    as this has side-effects of triggering upstart chroot sessions.
  * Lose the unnecessary postinst boilerplate.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: adjust test case to not key on the text
    of error messages which will vary depending on whether /bin/sh is
    dash or bash; and use TEST_STR_MATCH so that in the event of future
    failures, we know why it's failing.
  * Drop the hard-coded dep on sysv-rc; we already depend on initscripts
    which depends on sysv-rc | file-rc, and file-rc now has upstart support,
    so we don't need to force users to choose between upstart and file-rc.

  * debian/upstart.apport: Check session state file set before attempting
    to add an apport tag. 
  * debian/user-conf/logrotate.conf: Move sleep from pre-start to main stanza
    to ensure session shutdown is fast even in the case where it is triggered
    soon after login.
  * Optimise and speed-up session logout (LP: #1227212)

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Use ${libdir} instead of including /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk.
  * Drop manual symlinking of manpages, the upstream rules do this fine
    for us already.

upstart (1.9.1-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ James Hunt ]
  * debian/upstart.apport:
    - Added session count to report ('UpstartRunningSessionCount').
    - Join Upstart session to ensure 'UpstartRunningSessionJobs' shows
      session jobs and doesn't default to showing system ones.
  * debian/copyright: Update year.
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/{control,libupstart*}: Add libupstart packaging.
  * debian/rules:
    - Delete upstart-dbus-bridge.conf to avoid running it at the system level.
    - Install libupstart.pc to correct multi-arch location.
  * debian/upstart.postinst: Handle safe removal of
    upstart-dbus-bridge.conf (which is not used at the system level).
  * debian/control: Add build-depends on automake >= 1.12 for serial-tests
    in configure.ac (LP: #1197529).
  * debian/libupstart-dev.install: Specify wildcarded path (for multi-arch).

upstart (1.8-0ubuntu7) saucy; urgency=low

  * Simplify postinst re-exec logic by removing runlevel checks. Now the
    logic is:
    - re-exec if lossless stateful re-exec is available
    - perform partial stateful re-exec, unless running under upstart
    - re-exec if upgrading from pre dbus capable upstart
    - do nothing if running from chroot
    - otherwise hint that init is upgraded

upstart (1.8-0ubuntu6) saucy; urgency=low

  * debian/upstart.postinst:
    - When only partial stateful re-exec is available, and upgrade is run by
      cloud-config simply leave init upgraded.
    - When partial stateful re-exec is not performed also leave reboot required marker.

upstart (1.8-0ubuntu5) saucy; urgency=low

  * Change upstart's version string, such that postinst can detect whether
    the running upstart instance has full serialization fixes.
  * In postinst, check running upstart for the above version number or 1.9
    or better and then perform lossless stateful re-execution. Other wise
    check for runlevels 2-5 and perform partial stateful re-execution.

    - Preserve event blockers during configuration reload.
    - Serialise & deserialise blocking events during stateful
      re-execution.
  * debian/manpages/upstart-events.7: Added ':sys:restarted'.
  * debian/upstart.postinst: Don't re-exec if runlevel is not 2
    yet (to allow cloud-init to dist-upgrade upstart safeily in early boot).

  [ Dmitrijs Ledkovs ]
  * Upload to saucy.
  * Use "serial-tests" harness during build, instead of the automake's

  [ St√©phane Graber ]
  * Call autoreconf so we can use the same packaging for snapshots as for

  [ James Hunt ]
  * init/log.c: Cherry-pick of upstream fix for jobs which end before
    the log disk becomes writeable and which spawn off additional
    processes which persist after the main job process has ended
    (LP: #1096531).

upstart (1.6.1-1ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Merge with Debian.
    - drop debian/conf/dbus-reconnect.conf again, only needed in Debian.
    - don't build against libselinux; this is probably fine to have in
      Ubuntu, but this isn't the time to add it.
    - back down the Debian-specific versioned depends on sysvinit, ifupdown,
      udev
  * Export $TERM in init/Makefile.am; the Debian buildds don't set this,
    which results in test failures because of assumptions that it will be
    available.
  * Hard-code a dependency on libjson0 (>= 0.10-1.1ubuntu1), the first
    version of the package that installs to /lib instead of /usr/lib.

  [ James Hunt ]
  * debian/upstart-job: Allow script to operate quietly by reading optional
    /etc/default/upstart-job configuration. Thanks to Jouko Orava
    (LP: #613231) 
  * debian/control: Added debianutils for ischroot(1).
  * debian/upstart.postinst: Enabled stateful re-exec handling in selected
    upgrade scenarios. Details:
    - Only query running version if initctl is known to work.
    - Discard initctl stderr just in case.
    - Do not re-exec if running in a chroot (uses ischroot(1)).
    - Removed redundent check on previously installed version.
    - Updated lengthy commentary.

  [ St√©phane Graber ]
  * debian/apparmor-profile-load: Ignore output from running-in-container.
    This prevents the output of running-in-container from being appended to
    rsyslog's upstart log (and any other job calling apparmor-profile-load).

  [ Dmitrijs Ledkovs, James Hunt ]

    the signal lists in /proc/self/status fit in an unsigned long int
    - patently untrue on mips, where we have 128 signals for historical
    reasons.

  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: cherry-pick upstream fix for test which
    was accidentally relying on a variable persisting after it's gone out of
    scope.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: drop change to print path in the test,     
    should be fixed by the above.
  * init/job_class.[ch]: instead of assuming a fixed value (0) as the
    default nice value for job processes, use whatever the nice value of the
    current process is.  This will be important later for user sessions
    where an entire session may be started with a higher nice value; and it
    fixes running the test suite as part of a nice'd build.

  * New maintainer.

  * Drop /etc/init/dbus-reconnect.conf, no longer needed.
  * Add new jobs from Ubuntu: console, container-detect, failsafe,
    flush-early-job-log, rcS.conf, shutdown, wait-for-state.
  * Use 'linux-any' in the architecture check in debian/control, instead of

    answer whether upstart is running in a container.
  * refresh soon-to-be-obsolete upstart-job helper from Ubuntu.
  * Add bash-completion support.
  * Add /var/log/upstart directory and logrotate support.
  * Don't re-exec init on upgrade, we don't currently support stateful
    re-exec.
  * Switch to source format 1.0 for consistency with Ubuntu and for sane(r)
    VCS handling.
  * Add versioned dependencies on ifupdown and udev for the prerequisite
    boot events.
  * util/shutdown.c: look for sysvinit at /run/initctl before /dev/initctl,
    so that we're compatible with both the old and new paths used by
    sysvinit in Debian.  Closes: #659540.
  * Move to bzr for the official package Vcs, for greater synergy with the
    Ubuntu packaging.
  * Use copyright-format/1.0 for debian/copyright.  This drops Scott from
    the list of copyright holders, as an individual copyright is not

  * Fix "unhandled error" in shutdown when unable to change runlevel,
    e.g. due to previous Ubiquity bug.  LP: #426332.
  * Merge change from trunk that makes it possible to build Upstart using
    a previously built copy of nih-dbus-tool, especially useful when
    cross-compiling.  LP: #426740.
  * Merge change from libnih to store our assertion messages in the
    glibc __abort_msg symbol so apport can pick them up.  LP: #429411.
  * Merge change from libnih to fix compilation issue with eglibc due
    to changed alphasort() prototype.

      cheap way to test for that. 
  * Remove "console owner" and "console output" from rc scripts.

  * Reduce the priority of the stopped by/continued by messages so that
    they are only shown when --verbose on the kernel command-line.
    LP: #401333.
  * Add a hack to look for /dev/.initramfs/*.pid files on startup and
    "fake" start jobs of those names.  Basically this means that "status"
    and "stop" work for things like bootchart and usplash.
  * Implement a "reload" command in initctl that retrieves the current pid
    of the job and sends it the HUP signal.  LP: #433544.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * debian/upstart-job:
    - give proper policy-compliant behavior of the start command: detect if
      the job is already running using upstart status, and if so return success.
    - same for the stop command: return success if the job is already stopped.
    - when $DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE is set, don't spit warnings out because
      it's not the user's fault - we're being invoked by a maintainer script.

  * New upstream release:
    - much improved initctl tool.

  * Update my standard prep_/undo_/rm_conffile functions to take into account
    current dpkg behaviour wrt obsolete conffiles.  The conffile is now moved
    out of the way in preinst and the moved file deleted in postinst, or moved
    back in postrm abort-upgrade.  This means it's not there when dpkg
    configures the new version, so the conffile is not left in the list.
  * Purge backups of modified obsolete conffiles when the package is purged.

  * Update runlevel and respawn rule generated in migrate-inittab.pl
    LP: #89314

  * Drop 00-libnih-update.patch and 01-libnih-sparc-ftbfs.patch; new upstream
    release includes an up-to-date libnih which contains both patches.
  * Drop 10-cant-stop-execless-job.patch; included upstream.

    latest bzr trunk version, required for the complex-event-config patch.
  * Applied 10-cant-stop-execless-job.patch from upstream; this corrects a
    bug where jobs without an "exec" or "script" stanza cannot be stopped.
  * Applied 20-complex-event-config.patch from upstream; this is an
    experimental implementation of the "on" keyword that allows definition
    of complex system states.

  * System V compatibility jobs updated to match new event names.
  * rcS job now sets PREVLEVEL and RUNLEVEL.  LP: #76304.

  * NOTE: After this upgrade, init will appear to have "forgotten" the
    process ids of your gettys, etc.  This is not a critical problem and

    - some upstart-specific options to shutdown and reboot dropped, as
      these are considered SysV-compat tools.

    - improved documentation.  LP: #68805.

  * shutdown and reboot moved to upstart-compat-sysv.

  * Replace the /usr/share/doc/* directory in upstart-logd,
    upstart-compat-sysv, system-services and startup-tasks with a symlink to
    /usr/share/doc/upstart.  This was actually done in a previous package,

    our sysvinit configuration).
  * Migrate common changes made to /etc/inittab to /etc/event.d by
    adjusting the installed conffiles.  Ubuntu: #61539.

upstart (0.2.7-5) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't set the current runlevel in /var/run/utmp to 0 or 6 if it is
    already either of those two values.  That way we don't end up with
    either 0 or 6 in the PREVLEVEL variable, which can cause

upstart (0.2.7-4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Can't just start rc-default once in single-user mode, because if we
    boot into that, that will just return us back to sulogin again.  Copy
    the script out of rc-default into rcS-sulogin to call telinit with the
    right default runlevel.  Ubuntu: #62189.

upstart (0.2.7-2) edgy; urgency=low

  * Ensure that the same version of upstart is installed as the version of
    upstart-compat-sysv and upstart-logd; as the IPC protocol may change
    between releases.

  * Adjust the rcS-sulogin job so that if sulogin exits the default runlevel
    is entered; but if the job is stopped (e.g. by shutdown) it isn't.  The
    solves the regression introduced in the previous release.

  * Revert upstream logd/"quiet" change in favour of doing it in our
    lsb logging functions instead; seems to work better (fsvo better).

  * Fix failure to shutdown while in single-user mode, however this means
    that for edgy you can't exit the sulogin shell to enter the default
    runlevel; explicitly say what works.  Ubuntu: #60626.

    output of jobs with "console logged" (the default) in their description
    to /var/log/boot.

  * Add /etc/event.d/rc0 that is run on the "halt" event (neither -H or -P
    given), and modify rc0-halt to run on "system-halt" (-H given) and
    rc0-poweroff to run on "power-off" (-P given).  Ubuntu: #59134.

  * Sync priority in debian/control with that in the archive (required)
  * Drop warning of dire consequences if you install upstart, seeing as it's
    installed by default.

  * Add new startup-tasks and system-services packages which will contain
    the /etc/event.d files themselves (other than the main ones).
  * Move tty definitions into system-services.
  * Modify tty definitions to start when the rcS task has finished.  This
    puts them in the "right" place when compared to gdm.  Ubuntu: #58630.

  * Correct rcS compatibility script to ignore any information in utmp so
    that all scripts are always run.  Ubuntu: #59203.
  * Make rcS the console owner while it runs, temporary fix for
    Ubuntu: #58609, #58794, #58796
