.SH Event Summary

This manual page summarizes well-known events generated by the Upstart
.BR init (8)
daemon.
It is not an exhaustive list of all possible events, but rather details
a standard set of events expected to be generated on any Ubuntu system
running Upstart.

The primary table, \fBTable 1\fP, encodes the well-known events, along
with the type of each event (listed in \fBTable 2\fP), the emitter of
the event (see \fBTable 3\fP) and the approximate time at which the
event could be generated. Additionally, the \fINote\fP column indexes
into \fBTable 4\fP for further details on a particular event.

The \fIRef\fP (Reference) column is used to refer to individual
events succinctly in the \fITime\fP column.

Note that the \(aq<\(aq and \(aq>\(aq characters in the \fITime\fP column denote
that the event in the \fIEvent\fP column occurs respectively before or
after the event specified in the \fITime\fP column (for example, the
\fBmounting\fP(7) event occurs "at some time" after the \fBstartup\fP(7)
event, and the \fBvirtual\-filesystems\fP(7) event occurs after the last
\fBmounted\fP(7) event relating to a virtual filesystem has been emitted).

For further details on events, consult the manual pages and the job
configuration files, usually located in \fI/etc/init\fP.

A@T{
Requires administrator to press Control-Alt-Delete key
combination on the console.
T}
B@Event generated when user performs graphical login.
C@T{
These are specific examples. \fBupstart\-udev\-bridge\fP(8) will emit
events which match the pattern, "\fIS\fP\-device\-\fIA\fP" where
\(aqS\(aq is the udev \fIsubsystem\fP and \(aqA\(aq is the udev \fIaction\fP. See
\fBudev\fP(7) and for further details. If you have sysfs
mounted, you can look in \fI/sys/class/\fP for possible values for subsystem.
T}
D@Note this is in the singular - there is no \(aqfilesystems\(aq event.
E@T{
Emitted when administrator presses Alt-UpArrow key combination on
the console.
T}
F@T{
Denotes Display Manager running (about to be displayed), but no users
logged in yet.
T}
G@Generated for each mount that completes successfully.
H@T{
Emitted when mount attempt for single entry from \fBfstab\fP(5)
for any filesystem type is about to begin.
T}
I@Emitted when Upstart receives the SIGPWR signal.
J@Initial event.
K@T{
Although the events are emmitted by \fBinit\fP(8), the instigator may be
\fBinitctl\fP(8) if a System Administrator has manually started or
stopped a job.
T}
L@\fI/etc/init/umountnfs.sh\fP.
M@Emitted when all virtual filesystems (such as \fI/proc\fR) mounted.
N@T{
Emitted when the \fI\-\-dev\-wait\-time\fP timeout is exceeded for
\fBmountall\fP(8).  This defaults to 30 seconds.

.SH Job lifecycle
.\"
.SS Starting a Job
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
Upstart emits the \fBstarting\fP(7) event denoting the job is
"about to start". The \fBstarting\fP(7) event completes.
.IP \n+[step] 3
If the \fBpre\-start\fP stanza exists, the pre\-start process is
spawned.
.IP \n+[step] 3
Upstart spawns the main process.
.sp
It then ascertains the \fIfinal\fP PID for the job which may be a
descendent of the immediate child process if \fBexpect fork\fP or
\fBexpect daemon\fP has been specified.
.IP \n+[step] 3
If the \fBpost\-start\fP stanza exists, the post\-start process is
spawned.
.IP \n+[step] 3
Upstart emits the \fBstarted\fP(7) event.
.sp 1
For services, when this event completes the main process will now be fully
running. If the job refers to a task, it will now have completed.

.SS Stopping a Job

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
If the \fBpre\-stop\fP stanza exists, the pre\-stop process is
spawned.
.IP \n+[step] 3
The main process is stopped:
.RS
.nr step2 1 1
.af step2 i
.IP \n[step2] 3
The SIGTERM signal is sent to the main process.
.sp 1
See \fBsignal\fP(7).
.IP \n+[step2] 3
Upstart waits for up to "kill timeout" seconds (default 5 seconds) for
the process to end.
.IP \n+[step2] 3
If the process is still running after the timeout, a SIGKILL is sent to the process.
.RE
.IP \n+[step] 3
Upstart emits the \fBstopping\fP(7) event.
.IP \n+[step] 3
If the \fBpost\-stop\fP stanza exists, the post\-stop process is
spawned.
.IP \n+[step] 3
Upstart emits the \fBstopped\fP(7) event.
.sp 1
When this event completes, the job is fully stopped.
