Description: event-based init daemon - essential binaries
 upstart is a replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles
 starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during
 shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.
 .
 This package provides all essential upstart components, sufficient
 for running user sessions managed by upstart.

Description: event-based init daemon - SysV links
 upstart is a replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles
 starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during
 shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.
 .
 This package provides the manual pages and links needed for upstart
 to replace sysvinit. Installing systemd-sysv will overwrite /sbin/init with a
 link to upstart.
