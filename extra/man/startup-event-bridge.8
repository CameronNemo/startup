.SH DESCRIPTION
.B startup\-event\-bridge
receives information about system

events that have completed
and creates session events for them.

It emits events which match the pattern ":sys:*". Forwarding any event that's
triggered on the system startup as well as a virtual "restarted" event when
startup itself is restarted (during upgrades).

This bridge should be run as a user, after the session bus has been setup and
only once per session init.
